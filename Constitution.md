# THE CONSTITUTION OF

# THE AUSTRALIAN GREENS - VICTORIA

## Chapter 1 — Objectives and Operation

### 1 The Australian Greens Victoria

1.1 The body known as THE AUSTRALIAN GREENS – Victoria is:

```
(a) the Victorian member body of the confederation of state-based political parties known as
the ‘Australian Greens’;
(b) registered with the Australian Electoral Commission (the AEC) under the name of
‘Australian Greens’ and registered with the Victorian Electoral Commission (the VEC)
under the name of ‘The Australian Greens – Victoria’;
(c) registered with the Registrar of Incorporated Associations under the name of ‘The Greens
Victoria Inc.’; and
(d) abbreviated to ‘the AGV’ or ‘the Party’ for the purposes of this Constitution.
```
1.2 This Constitution identifies the principles and rules governing the conduct of the AGV affairs
and defines the powers of the constituent groups and the roles of the positions defined within.

1.3 All other AGV documents are subordinate to this Constitution with the exception of the Charter.

1.4 The Constitution seeks to maximise opportunities for productive cooperation between AGV
Members and to provide protection for individual AGV Members and constituent groups.

1.5 The Constitution requires the constituent groups of the AGV to:

```
(a) agree to the Charter of the Greens, and to abide by this Constitution as well as to the
National Constitution of the Australian Greens, and to the proper decisions of the National
Organisation; and
(b) support affirmative action and practise participatory, democratic and accountable internal
decision-making processes.
```
1.6 The Constitution further requires that the AGV and all its constituent groups have autonomy to
make decisions relating to their own affairs, provided that these decisions remain compatible
with the Constitution, the Charter and the agreed policy frameworks of the Greens.

### 2 The Charter of the Greens

2.1 The Charter is the basic document of agreement which defines the principles and aims of the
Australian Greens. As such, AGV Members and constituent groups should not publicly forward
ideas at variance with the Charter without calling into question their continued membership of,
and status within, the AGV.

2.2 To change the Charter, an amendment must be supported in a plebiscite by at least 75 per cent of
eligible members of the Australian Greens nationwide. For the result of such a plebiscite to be
valid, at least 51 per cent of members of the Australian Greens must have participated.


### 3 Our Objectives

3.1 The primary purposes of the Greens Party are:

```
(a) to further a vision of the world characterised by peace, social justice, grassroots
participatory democracy and ecological sustainability;
(b) to make, publicise and strive to implement policies on national and global issues as
described in the Charter;
(c) to engage in education of both ourselves and the rest of the community, to raise awareness
of the issues and concerns covered in the Charter;
(d) to promote and assist other individuals, associations, organisations and community
networks, working for the objectives of the Greens;
(e) to promote the development of and participate and communicate with the Green political
movement both nationally and globally;
(f) to be a registered political party pursuant to the Commonwealth and Victorian Electoral
Acts;
(g) to seek the election or appointment to public office of people who are committed to the
Charter, principles, policies and objectives of the Greens;
(h) to encourage other political parties to adopt our policies and principles by electoral
strategies and direction of voting preferences;
(i) to coordinate mutual support and joint actions on behalf of Greens Party Members;
(j) to carry out such tasks as the membership may from time to time delegate to the State
body.
```
### 4 National and State Greens Parties

4.1 The Greens is a national confederation of State and territory parties. To facilitate smooth
operations between the State and National Organisation, the State Constitution must remain
broadly consistent and compatible with the National Constitution.

4.2 The Victorian National Delegates’ Convenor is responsible for co-ordinating the work of
Victorian delegates to National Council and National Conference of the Australian Greens. The
Victorian National Delegates’ Convenor must be and remain one of the AGV delegates to both
the National Council and the National Conference. State Council will enact a bylaw prescribing
how this position is filled.

### 5 Affirmative Action

5.1 The AGV is committed to equal opportunity principles and the principle of women, men and
gender diverse people having equal status within society.

5.2 The AGV will initiate affirmative action, where appropriate, for underrepresented groups, in
particular: (a) First Peoples; (b) women; and (c) gender-diverse people.

5.3 At no time will any AGV Member be discriminated against due to gender, age, race, ethnicity,
class, religion, disability, sexuality, marital status, health status, or any other perceived or actual
personal attribute.

7.1 An ‘applicant’ for AGV membership is a natural person whose membership application and fee
has been received by the AGV.

7.2 An individual may apply for AGV membership by paying the applicable membership fee and by
completing and submitting the membership application form which will contain, but is not
limited to, the following information:
(a) the name of the applicant;
(b) the residential address, including postcode, of the applicant;
(c) the postal address of the applicant, as well as the phone, fax, email or other electronic
contacts;


```
(d) A declaration signed by the applicant that they agree to be bound by the Charter and

```
7.3 The following bodies will have the power to admit an applicant as a Member:

```
(a) A Branch covering the area where the Member resides;
(b) The State Council or State Executive in respect of any application from an applicant where
there is no relevant Branch; and
(c) The State Council or State Executive in respect of any application from an applicant where
the relevant Branch has been aware of but failed to consider an application for at least 35
days.
Provided that should the relevant Branch or the State Executive at any time resolve that any
person’s application should be deferred for further consideration, or rejected, then no body (other
than the body which resolved to defer or reject the application) may later admit that person to
membership and no admission to membership made in error shall be valid. This shall not limit
State Council’s right to admit a person to membership.
```
7.4 Each application will be processed according to any bylaws formulated by the State Council.

7.5 An applicant will be welcomed as a new AGV Member, provided that person:

```
(a) has read and agreed to the Charter and agreed to abide by the constitutional rules of the
AGV;
(b) agrees to join the AGV and to be registered to a Branch (where one is established which
covers the applicant) according to residential address;

is a member party of the Australian Greens other than the AGV (the ‘other party’) may, if they
have moved to the State of Victoria or will imminently do so, request membership of the AGV.
In such circumstances, the State Secretary or person appointed by the State Secretary may admit
the person as a Member, provided that the information listed at 7.2(a) to (e), and any prescribed
fee, has been provided either by the person or the other party, and provided that membership of
the person to the other party ceases upon the person’s admission to the AGV. Where any doubt


```
arises as to whether the admission of a person under this clause is appropriate, the matter may be
referred to the State Executive for decision.
```

9.2 Each AGV Member will pay membership fees directly to the AGV.


9.3 Membership fees will fall due annually and will be paid in advance for a period of 12 months,

9.4 In this clause, ‘Membership Term’ means the 12 month period for which the membership fees
have been paid.

9.5 Before expiry of an AGV Member’s Membership Term, the AGV Member will be sent, to their
nominated contact address, which may be a postal address or an email address, a renewal notice
specifying:
(a) the date that the Membership Term is due to expire (‘Expiry Date’);
(b) how to renew their membership, including the amount to be paid; and
(c) such other matters as may be specified in the bylaws.

9.6 Membership will lapse and the person will no longer be an AGV Member if the membership fee

(a) the Expiry Date of the Membership Term; and
(b) 60 days after the renewal notice was sent.

membership fees have been paid only because of a violation of clause 9.10.

an organisation is to be considered a proscribed organisation. The decisions of State Council will

10.3 The membership status, contact details and other personal information of any AGV Member will
not be released to any non-Member or organisation without the authorisation of the AGV
Member, other than State and Federal electoral authorities, and the Australian Greens.

(e) Standing Committees created by and under this Constitution;
(f) working groups and committees established by the above constituent groups.
```
13.2 State Council will pass bylaws which specify the scope and coverage of Branches established
under this Constitution.

### 14 Census Date and Representational Matters

14.1 The State Executive will appoint a person or establish a committee prior to 31 January in each
year, which will be responsible for:
(a) ascertaining the numbers of Members and the Branch if any they are registered to on a
census date of 1 March in that year;
(b) determining the number, under this Constitution, of Branch (including regional)
Representatives who will be elected to State Council; and
(c) determining the placement of each Branch within the 8 Legislative Council regions for the
purpose of electing further Branch Representatives to State Council, where appropriate.

14.2 In determining the number of Members as at 1 March of each year, the person or committee will
receive all necessary support from AGV constituent groups, to enable that person or committee
to report to the State Executive by 31 March in each year.

14.3 The person or committee will:

```
(a) prepare a draft report by 14 March setting out the names and numbers of all AGV members
and the Branch to which each is registered to if applicable and, separately:
(i) specifying whether or not each Branch qualifies as being entitled to elect a Branch
Representative to the State Council at its Annual General Meeting in accordance
with clause 40.2(a);
(ii) determining the Legislative Council region each Branch falls into, for the purposes of
clause 40.2(b), which shall be the Legislative Council region that a plurality of
members of the Branch reside within, subject to Schedule 1 where there is more than
one Branch in a Local Government Area; and
```

```
(iii) determining the total number of Representatives who will represent Branches from
each notional Legislative Council region on the State Council, as described in
clause 40.2;
(b) forward relevant sections of the draft report to all Branches for comment, not less than 14
days before their scheduled consideration by the State Executive;
(c) consider Branch comment which is received not less than 7 days before the report’s
scheduled consideration by the State Executive;
(d) provide to the State Executive an updated draft report which includes any amendments
suggested by a Branch, or if such amendment is not included the Branch comment will be
included as an appendix.
```
14.4 Upon receiving the updated draft report the State Executive will, by 31 March, either endorse it
or amend it to reflect comments made by a Branch or to correct any error.

14.5 Upon endorsing it and by 7 April, the State Executive will release the report to State Council
members, and the relevant portions of the report to Branches, and the findings of that report will
be binding on those Branches, and on all Returning Officers appointed to oversight the filling of
relevant positions.

14.6 Any new Branch formed after the census date with 15 or more Members will be entitled to one
Branch Representative on State Council. This will not affect any other representation on State
Council until the next elections for State Council representatives.

### 15 AGV Office Bearers

15.1 The Office Bearers of the AGV will be the Convenor, Secretary, Treasurer, and an Assistant
Secretary, who will hold such office for the purposes of the Party and the State Council and
Executive.

15.2 Office Bearers will be AGV Members who are resident in Victoria.

15.3 The powers and duties of Office Bearers are defined within this Constitution.

15.4 Office Bearer positions may be held on a job-share basis.

15.5 Job-share Office Bearers will make arrangements with the Executive for the apportioning of
duties and responsibilities.

15.6 Wherever this Constitution specifies the attendance of a particular Office Bearers as a quorum
requirement for a meeting, the attendance of one of the job-share Office Bearers will be
sufficient to satisfy such a requirement.

15.7 Job-share Office Bearer positions will be entitled to one vote only. On any question on which the
job-share Office Bearers differ, and both exercise their right to vote, their votes will cancel each
other out.

15.8 An individual elected to any Office Bearer position ceases to be an Office Bearer if the
individual:
(a) ceases to be an AGV Member;
(b) resigns in writing; or


```
(c) is suspended by the State Council because the individual is unable or unwilling to act to
fulfil their designated responsibilities.
```
15.9 Where an Office Bearer, or a Victorian Campaign Committee Convenor or a Policy Convenor,
who holds a position on a job-share basis ceases to hold office but the other person who also
holds that position does not cease to hold office, then the remaining holder of that office holds
office until the end of the next meeting of the State Council, which shall at that meeting make a
determination to either:
(a) confirm the remaining holder of the position as the only holder of that position, in a secret
ballot vote which shall require 75% of votes cast to be in favour; or
(b) confirm a nomination made by the remaining holder of that position, of another member to
fill the vacancy and serve in the position on a job-share basis, in a vote requiring 75% of
votes cast to be in favour.
In the absence of the occurrence of (a) or (b) at that meeting, the position becomes vacant.

### 16 Election of State Office Bearers

16.1 State Office Bearer will be elected annually by postal or electronic ballot of all AGV Members
prior to the Annual Conference.

16.2 If any Office Bearer position remains unfilled after the annual postal or electronic ballot for any
reason, that position may be elected by all AGV Members present at the Annual Conference or at
a Special State Conference. If elected at a State Conference, State Office Bearers will be elected
by consensus or, failing this consensus, they will be elected by a secret ballot of all AGV
Members present at the State Conference.

16.3 Any vote will be by an optional preferential system and will include an option to ‘seek further
candidates’ rather than requiring election of one of the candidates.

16.4 A person to be appointed as State Secretary must have attained the age of eighteen years, not be
a holder of any public office, and be and remain a resident of Australia.

16.5 State Office Bearers are elected for a term of one year or until the next Annual State Conference.

16.6 An individual who has served three consecutive terms (or parts thereof) in any combination of
State Office Bearer positions will not be eligible for re-election as an Office Bearer at the next
election but will in any case be eligible for subsequent elections. These provisions can be waived
by consensus decision of State Council.

16.7 Candidates for State Office Bearer positions will have given their consent to the Members (or
State Conference, if appropriate), in person or in writing, to standing for such office.

16.8 If a casual vacancy for any State Office Bearer position occurs more than three months before
the term of office was due to end, a postal or electronic vote of all AGV Members or a Special
State Conference must be held to fill the vacant position, save that where a single nomination is
received for the casual vacancy then State Council may appoint that person to fill the position
without the need for any postal or electronic ballot or any Special State Conference.

16.9 If at any time a State Office Bearer position is vacant, the State Council will, within fourteen
days after the vacancy arises, appoint an acting State Office Bearer from the existing members of
State Council, who will:


```
(a) have the same powers and responsibilities as an elected State Office Bearer until a new
duly-elected Office Bearer is installed; and
(b) cease to be an acting State Office Bearer when a new duly-elected State Office Bearer has

that Legislative Council region. Included in this entitlement are those Branch
Representatives described in clause 40.2(a);
(iii) Where the entitled number of Branch Representatives for any Legislative Council
region exceeds the number of Branch Representatives for which provision has been
made in clause 40.2(a), additional Branch Representatives will be elected by and
from the members registered to Branches assigned in the census to the Legislative
Council region/s in question. The candidates for election will be ranked in order, and
once elected will represent the viewpoints of their Branch as well as other Branches
within the region.

40.3 All Branch Representatives on State Council will be expected to attend meetings of their Branch
in order to best represent those who elected them at the State Council.

40.4 In the event that a person who has been elected or appointed to be a Branch Representative on
State Council ceases to be eligible to be a member of the Branch which the Member represents,
the Member will immediately cease to be a Branch Representative on State Council unless the
relevant Branch resolves at its next meeting to keep the person as its Branch Representative.

40.5 Local, state and national holders of public office will be represented on State Council as follows:

```
(a) The group of AGV federal parliamentarians elected to the Senate and House of

among their number up to three State Council representatives;

for each State Council meeting up to three State Council representatives, provided that the
AGV Leaders in each House are included in this number;
(c) The group of AGV Victorian local government representatives may for each State Council
meeting select from among their number up to three State Council representatives.
```

Branch Representative elected under clause 40.2(b) from a Legislative Council region.

40.8 A member of State Council vacates their office if any of the following circumstances occur:

```
(a) the member resigns their office by written notice addressed to the State Council or
Executive;
(b) the member (other than those members listed in clause 40.5) is absent without the consent
of State Council from 3 consecutive meetings of State Council (not including meetings for
which less than 21 days’ notice was given), whether or not a proxy was appointed under
clause 40.9. To avoid doubt, where a job share position (as defined in clause 15.4) is being
occupied by two persons, each of them is deemed to have attended any State Council
meeting which was attended by one of them;
(c) the member is removed from office by special resolution of AGV Members;
(d) the member:
(i) dies; or
(ii) becomes insolvent; or
(iii) becomes a represented person (under the Guardianship and Administration Act

```
40.9 The bylaws may provide for alternate representation of a Branch representative who is a member
under 40.2 by a proxy, in any circumstance where the Branch representative is unable to attend a
State Council meeting, provided any such bylaw includes that:
(a) A person ineligible to be elected to the position on State Council of the proxy giver may
not receive a proxy;
(b) No person may exercise more than one vote at State Council.

40.10 Notwithstanding clause 40.2(a), a Branch becomes eligible to elect a Branch Representative at
the moment it has 15 or more AGV members registered to it, and becomes ineligible to elect a
replacement Branch Representative under clause 24.1(e) at the moment that it has fewer than 15
AGV members registered to it.

42.5 State Council may pass a resolution that dissociates a Branch or other Party body statement or
other action from the AGV position on the matter or matters, if there are strong and compelling
reasons to do so. To the extent possible, the Branch statement or other action is revoked by such

decision so taken prior to the State Council meeting in which the decision is considered.

46.8 The State Executive has a responsibility to supervise and co-ordinate the activities of the

(a) Branch meetings precede State Council meetings;
(b) A State Council meeting should be held no later than 2 weeks prior to a National Council

### 48 Decision Making in Meetings

48.1 Decisions at all meetings of AGV constituent groups will be made primarily by consensus, and a
serious attempt at all times will be made towards achieving consensus. Sufficient time will be
allowed for discussion of different views, including provision for non-decision making meetings.

48.2 Except where this Constitution requires a decision to be made by consensus only, if, after a
reasonable period of time, disagreement persists and a decision should not be deferred, the
question of moving to a vote on a substantive motion will be resolved by a vote. The procedural
question to this effect will be deemed to have been carried if it is supported by at least a 75
percent majority.

48.3 A substantive motion carried by vote, unless provided for elsewhere in the Constitution, requires
at least a 75 per cent majority of votes cast. Abstentions may be recorded but will not count as a
vote, either for or against.

48.4 When voting occurs, it will be conducted by a show of hands, except in the case of contested
elections which will be determined by a ballot. Voting of all members of the group will be
recorded. Voting by proxy will be allowed at meetings of constituent groups if specifically
allowed by the bylaws.

48.5 A motion regarding a procedural question is carried if a majority of valid votes are in favour of
the motion. Abstentions do not count as a vote, either for or against. For the purposes of this
clause, a procedural question includes proposals deemed to be procedural questions under
Standing Orders issued by the State Council as a bylaw.

48.6 Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 48.5, a procedural motion to:

```
(a) put a substantive motion to a vote; or
(b) suspend the operation of the Standing Orders;
will require at least a 75 per cent majority of votes cast.
```
48.7 All AGV meetings and processes should ensure maximum participation of all involved,
including by using small group discussions, subcommittees or working parties where
appropriate.

48.8 All meetings of the AGV will be open to all AGV Members and invited members of the general
public. At meetings of constituent groups consisting of elected representatives or delegates, the
degree of participation of non-representatives/delegates can be constrained as detailed elsewhere
in this Constitution as well as at the discretion of the meeting facilitator/convenor.

49 Decision Making through Postal or Electronic Ballots

49.1 A constituent group meeting may decide to poll relevant AGV Members through a postal or
electronic ballot (to be funded by the constituent group). For the results of the ballot to be valid,
a minimum of 10 per cent of the AGV members polled must have participated in the ballot. For a
motion to succeed it must be approved by at least 75 percent of the valid votes cast.

49.2 Provision will be made available for important or contentious issues for the AGV to be resolved
by postal or electronic ballot of all Members, and will be convened if initiated by 10% of
individual AGV Members. For the results of the plebiscite to be valid, a minimum of 10 per cent
of AGV Members must have participated in the plebiscite. For a motion to succeed it needs to be
approved by at least 75 per cent of the valid votes cast.


49.3 State Council must decide on how the motions will be put on the ballot paper, as well as how
supporting and opposing arguments will be made available to Members with the ballot paper.

49.4 When an electronic ballot is held, State Council must make adequate alternate voting
arrangements for eligible Members who are not readily able to access the relevant electronic
means.

49.5 Postal or electronic votes will be counted by the Returning Officer appointed by the State
Council.

49.6 State Council may make further provision for the manner of conducting electronic or postal
ballots in a bylaw.

##### 50 Quick Decision Making

50.1 Any Party body of the AGV may establish and (at each year’s AGM) elect members to a Quick
Decision Making Group (QDMG) comprised of members of that Party body, to facilitate the
making of urgent decisions. A casual vacancy may be filled from time to time.

50.2 The functions and powers of a Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) are as follows:

```
(a) The QDMG will make decisions for the Party body regarding any matter of such urgency
that it must be resolved before the next scheduled meeting of the Party body;
(b) Whilst it is the Convenor who is normally required to attempt to contact all QDMG
members, if necessary, any member of the QDMG can call the meeting.
```
50.3 The composition of the Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) is as follows:

```
(a) The QDMG for the State Executive will comprise the State Convenor, the State Secretary,
the State Treasurer and three persons appointed by and from the other members of the
State Executive;
(b) For all other Party bodies, the QDMG will comprise any two of that Party body’s
Convenor, Secretary, and Treasurer (if it has one), and two other persons elected from the
other members of the Party body;
(c) quorum will be four decision-making members of the State Executive’s QDMG, or three
members for any other Party body’s QDMG.
```
50.4 Procedures for the Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) include the following:

```
(a) The QDMG will meet only as often as essential;
(b) The QDMG may meet face to face or by teleconference, or by electronic communication.
In emergencies, the QDMG may simply engage in telephone consultation;
(c) In matters relating to particular regions or issues, the QDMG will consult where possible
with constituent groups or Party Members who may be directly affected by the decision;
(d) The QDMG’s decisions will be made by consensus only.
```
50.5 The Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) must keep a written record of any decisions made
and present it to the next meeting of its Party body.

50.6 Decisions of a Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) take effect immediately. If a decision of
a QDMG is not ratified by the conclusion of the next quorate meeting of its Party body, the
decision lapses and, to the maximum extent possible, is to be taken to have never been made.


#### Chapter 4 — Elected Officials

##### 51 Greens in Public Office

51.1 The actions and activities of AGV Members who hold public office, and of all endorsed
candidates for the AGV, must be consistent with the Charter of the Greens, and with the
Objectives of the AGV laid down in this Constitution.

51.2 AGV Members who hold public office as endorsed candidates of the Greens will also adhere to
the policies of the Greens, except that, in rare or special circumstances where the views of an
elected Member are in conflict with the Greens’ policy, then that elected Member may vote
according to their conscience.

51.3 When an elected Member or candidate recognises a potential conflict between their conscience
and the Greens’ policy, then such an elected representative or candidate will furnish a statement
accounting for this position to the State Council, and in the case of a member of Federal
Parliament, to the National Council of the Australian Greens, for their information. AGV
Members elected to, or candidates for, positions in local government will provide such a
statement to their Branch, where the circumstances require it.

51.4 The obligation of an AGV public officer to comply with Greens policy is met when that Member
complies with the approved Greens policy relevant to their jurisdiction.

51.5 Where more than one AGV Member is elected to any jurisdiction, each elected Member has an
obligation to attempt to reach a consensus position on all substantive matters before them.

51.6 When an elected AGV Member does not vote for the implementation of an AGV policy, then
they will, at the earliest opportunity, furnish a statement to the State Council, accounting for the
reason why he or she so voted.

51.7 Members in public office may hold meetings with AGV Members in their electorate from time to
time and will do so within thirty days of being requested to do so by:
(a) ten percent or 50 (whichever is the lesser) of the Members in the relevant electorate; or
(b) a Branch or Branches representing one-third of the Members in the electorate; or
(c) State Council in the case of the Senator(s) representing Victoria.

51.8 The agenda for an electorate meeting will include any matters placed on it by the public office
holder or by the Members requesting the meeting, or by any Branch within the electorate.
Electorate meetings do not have binding decision-making power.

51.9 Subject to clause 51.10, members who hold public office must not:

```
(a) to any degree, displace or interfere with the role of the Mediation Panel (except in matters
that are exclusively between members who hold public office), Administrative Review
Panel or Misconduct Panel; and
(b) make any public statement regarding a matter being dealt with, or that has been dealt with,
under chapters 8, 9 or 10 that has not been approved in writing (in specific or general
terms) by the State Convenor.
```
51.10 Clause 51.9(a) does not prohibit a member who holds public office from requesting assistance
under clause 79.1, making an application under clause 83.1 or making a misconduct allegation
under clause 87.1.


#### Chapter 5 — Electoral Processes

##### 52 Overview

52.1 The purpose of this Chapter is to regulate the formation, adoption and management of processes
for electoral and continuous campaigning for the political purposes of the AGV. State Council
may make bylaws to facilitate any element of the processes outlined hereunder.

52.2 Although Branches are recognised as the primary organising unit for election purposes, this
Constitution authorises the creation of regional campaign committees based on such boundaries
as State Council may determine, to facilitate election management and continuous campaigning
where they are best managed across more than one Branch or group of Branches.

52.3 To facilitate the management of electoral and continuous campaigning on a state-wide basis, this
Constitution authorises the creation of a Standing Committee of State Council for electoral and
continuous campaigning purposes.

52.4 State electoral and continuous campaigning policies will be formulated with the maximum
participation of AGV Members and Branches through the meeting procedures outlined in
chapter 3.6, and must actively consider input from relevant expert persons or bodies, including
that provided by the national office of the Party and any elected Greens public official.

##### 53 The Victorian Campaign Committee

53.1 Reporting to State Council, the formulation of state-wide AGV electoral and continuous
campaigning policy and the management of its application will be the responsibility of the
Victorian Campaign Committee created as a Standing Committee of State Council under this
Chapter.

53.2 The Victorian Campaign Committee is responsible for:

```
(a) developing electoral and continuous campaigning policy with state-wide cover for local
government and state parliamentary elections, and managing such campaigns;
(b) liaising with regional campaign committees and Branches to facilitate the goals of this
Chapter;
(c) collaborating with relevant Party bodies to develop national electoral and continuous
campaigning policy;
(d) reporting to State Council on all other matters referred to it by State Council; and
(e) any other electoral or continuous campaigning related functions given to it by State
Council or under the bylaws.
```
53.3 The Victorian Campaign Committee will establish a Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) in
accordance with section 50.

##### 54 The Victorian Campaign Committee Convenor

54.1 The Convenor of the Victorian Campaign Committee will be elected by all AGV Members by
annual postal or electronic ballot (though if the position remains unfilled after the annual postal
or electronic ballot for any reason, that position may be elected by all AGV Members present at
the Annual Conference or at a Special State Conference by consensus or, failing this consensus,
by a secret ballot of all AGV Members present), and will be a voting member of the State


```
Executive and State Council. An individual who has served two consecutive terms as Convenor
will not be eligible for re-election at the next election (but will in any case be eligible for
subsequent elections), unless this provision is waived by consensus decision of State Council.
```
54.2 The position of Convenor of the Victorian Campaign Committee may be held on a job-share
basis, in which case clauses 15.5, 15.6 and 15.7 shall apply as though ‘Office Bearers’ means
‘Convenors of the Victorian Campaign Committee’ and ‘Executive’ means ‘Victorian Campaign
Committee’, and clause 15.9 will also apply.

54.3 The Convenor of the Victorian Campaign Committee will:

```
(a) be responsible for managing the meetings, agenda and responsibilities of the committee in
a way which facilitates the effective delivery of the electoral and continuous campaigning
objectives of the AGV;
(b) convene urgent meetings of the committee’s Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) as
required to address urgent and pressing electoral and continuous campaigning related
matters;
(c) attend whenever possible all meetings of the State Executive, to ensure electoral and
continuous campaigning considerations are taken into account in all State Executive
decisions;
(d) regularly report to the State Executive and State Council on the normal business of the
committee, and refer committee recommendations to the State Executive and State Council
for decision on actions where appropriate;
(e) liaise with any elected public officials, and facilitate their involvement in the Victorian
Campaign Committee processes;
(f) confer with the AGV body given responsibility for national electoral and continuous
campaigning matters;

```
##### 55 Electorate Campaign Committees

55.1 For any Local Government election in which the AGV will be supporting a candidate (subject to
Schedule 1 where there is more than one Branch in a Local Government Area), the campaign
will be directed by the relevant Branch, or a committee established by that Branch. In the case of
there being no relevant Branch, the campaign will be directed either by an adjacent Branch, or
the corresponding Regional Council (or a committee established by that Regional Council) if no
adjacent Branch exists or is willing to direct the campaign, or the Victorian Campaign
Committee if there is no corresponding Regional Council.

55.2 For any Federal Senate election in which in which the AGV will be supporting a candidate, the
campaign will be directed by the Victorian Campaign Committee.

the campaign for each electorate will be directed by a regional campaign committee if one has
been established, or by the Victorian Campaign Committee if no regional campaign committee
has been established.


55.4 For any Victorian Legislative Assembly or Federal House of Representatives election in which
the AGV will be supporting a candidate, the campaign for each electorate will be directed by a
committee, such that:
(a) where there is a Branch or Branches in existence with coverage within the bounds of the
electorate, the campaign will be directed by a standing electorate campaign committee,
unless all Branches in existence with coverage within that electorate have agreed that there
should not be a standing electorate campaign committee in which case the campaign will
be directed by a regional campaign committee if one has been established, or by the
Victorian Campaign Committee if no regional campaign committee has been established;
or
(b) where there is not a Branch or Branches in existence within the bounds of the electorate,
the campaign will be directed by a regional campaign committee if one has been
established, or by the Victorian Campaign Committee if no regional campaign committee
has been established.

55.5 Subject to this section, standing electorate campaign committees are accountable to the Branches
and AGV Members which fall within their jurisdiction, and each must therefore include among
its membership provision for at least one representative from each Branch in existence within the
jurisdiction of the committee. State Council may enact bylaws to further determine the powers,
responsibilities, membership structures, and mechanisms for periodic review of jurisdiction, of
standing electorate campaign committees.

55.6 Regional campaign committees may be established in advance of any State or Federal general
election, either by State Council deciding to establish a new regional campaign committee, or by
State Council permitting an existing Regional Council to also act as a regional campaign
committee. Where established, regional campaign committees will:
(a) direct the campaign for any electorate which falls to it under clauses 55.3 and 55.4;
(b) facilitate the cooperation of any standing electorate campaign committees which
correspond to its area;
(c) abide by terms of reference determined by State Council upon establishment; and
(d) dissolve one month after the election for which they were established.

55.7 All regional campaign committees, standing electorate campaign committees, and Branches or
committees established by Branches under clause 55.1, will:
(a) appoint a campaign co-ordinator (which may be an Office Bearer or any other committee
member), and will authorise the coordinator to expend funds up to a specified limit;
(b) provide all necessary information to the State Convenor, the Secretary and the Treasurer,
Party Agent and Registered Officer for the purposes of compliance with the relevant
Commonwealth or Victorian legislation; and
(c) keep its own separate set of record books and where required to do so must furnish the
relevant Electoral Commission with accurate financial records for them to check. The
following must also be recorded separately:
(i) all gifts as defined in the relevant legislation;
(ii) records of election expenses; and


```
(iii) claims for reimbursement of electoral expenses up to the amount allowed, if
applicable.
```
55.8 Financial records relating to election campaign expenses will be kept for five years following the
election to which they relate.

55.9 A standing electorate campaign committee may be suspended by:

```
(a) a concurrent decision of all Branches in existence within the jurisdiction of the committee;
or
(b) by a decision of State Council if there is evidence that the committee is seriously failing to
meet its Constitutional or financial responsibilities or persistently breaches State Council
decisions;
(c) in which case the direction of the campaign will transfer to the relevant regional campaign
committee if there is one, or the Victorian Campaign Committee if there is not, for the
duration of the suspension.
```
55.10 A regional campaign committee may be dissolved by a decision of State Council if there is
evidence that the committee is seriously failing to meet its Constitutional or financial
responsibilities or persistently breaches State Council decisions, in which case the direction of
the campaign will transfer to the Victorian Campaign Committee.

##### 56 Pre-selection and Endorsement

56.1 State Council may enact bylaws to determine the method to be used for pre-selecting candidates
to stand for any election as an endorsed AGV candidate. In lieu of any bylaws, State Council
will, in good time before each general election for federal parliament, state parliament and local
government, determine the method to be used for pre-selecting candidates to stand at that
election as an endorsed AGV candidate. In either case, State Council may determine different
methods for individual electorates or positions on a ticket in a given election, such as
differentiating between targeted electorates or lead candidates and other electorates or
candidates, and the determined method or methods must be used consistently by all Party bodies
in Victoria responsible for conducting pre-selections for that election.

56.2 In the event that State Council has not specified a method under clause 56.1, the default pre-
selection method for all electorates and candidates will be an electronic or postal ballot of all
AGV Members living within the corresponding electorate.

56.3 The pre-selection in accordance with the method determined by State Council under clause 56.1
will be conducted by:
(a) The Branch in which the relevant Local Government Area is located in the case of
elections for local government, subject to Schedule 1 where there is more than one Branch
in a Local Government Area;
(b) The standing electorate campaign committee covering the relevant Victorian Legislative
Assembly or Federal House of Representatives electorate in the case of elections to those
chambers (or the regional campaign committee covering the relevant electorate if there is
no standing electorate campaign committee covering the relevant electorate);
(c) The regional campaign committee covering the relevant Victorian Legislative Council
electorate in the case of elections to that chamber;


```
(d) The State Council in the case of elections for the Federal Senate and any other bodies
elected by a state-wide electorate;
(e) Such body as the State Council determines in the case of election to any other body.
```
56.4 If there is no Branch or election campaign committee covering a given electorate, or the relevant
Branch or election campaign committee reports that it is unable or unwilling to conduct the pre-
selection, the State Council may designate another body to conduct the pre-selection for that
electorate.

56.5 State Council may determine a date by which a particular class of pre-selections must occur, and
in default of this, may determine any other necessary matter regarding the conduct of pre-
selections.

56.6 If there is only one candidate for election for public office, endorsement will nevertheless be
required in accordance with the procedure established under clause 56.1, conducted by the
relevant body specified in clause 56.3.

56.7 In the case of a casual vacancy in an office previously held by an endorsed AGV office holder in
the Federal Senate, the Victorian Legislative Council or any other body for which a casual
vacancy requires the AGV to nominate a replacement office holder, a new pre-selection must be
held. The rules in this section will apply as if the pre-selection for the casual vacancy were a
general election to that body.

56.8 In the case of a by-election, the State Council will determine a method for pre-selecting
candidates and determine which body will be responsible for conducting the pre-selection.

56.9 In exceptional circumstances State Council may exercise a veto option on candidates proposed
by a Branch or an election campaign committee. A veto must be supported by 75 per cent of the
State Council, which may then propose a new candidate if the relevant Branch or election
campaign committee does not opt to do so.

56.10 All approved candidates must be AGV Members.

56.11 Candidates for public office who have been pre-selected under section 56 will be recognised as
endorsed candidates of the Greens.

56.12 Sitting parliamentarians and local government representatives will also go through the candidate
selection process before each relevant election.

56.13 No AGV Member will nominate or stand for election in any local government, or State or
Federal parliament other than as an endorsed candidate of the AGV, unless approved by State
Council.

56.14 A Member must not be in breach of clause 56.13 at the close of nominations.

56.15 Any person who applies for AGV membership while standing for election to, or after having
been elected to, any local government, or State or Federal parliament will require:
(a) acceptance as an AGV Member, and
(b) endorsement pursuant to the pre-selection process set out in clause 56, and
(c) endorsement by State Council.

56.16 A Member who is elected to Public Office on a countback and who was not endorsed by the
Party to be a candidate for that Public Office must immediately notify State Council by giving


```
written notice to the State Secretary. If State Council does not endorse that member for that
Public Office within 3 months of them taking that Public Office, or if State Council decides that
the member is not endorsed, that member must either resign that Public Office or resign their
Party membership.
```
56.17 Nothing in this section or in any bylaw made thereunder, conducted by the relevant body
specified in clause 56.3, shall be taken as preventing any measure which is deemed necessary to
ensure that the AGV or Australian Greens has a candidate in any seat in any State or Federal
election in circumstances where any present or future preselection process which would
otherwise apply cannot or would not be completed due to the calling of an early election at short
notice.

##### 57 Allocation of Preferences

57.1 The decision on the allocation of preferences for local government electorates may be made by
Branches, subject to Schedule 1 where there is more than one Branch in a Local Government
Area. If there is any ambiguity as to whether a Branch has authority in a particular case, the
dispute will be resolved by the State Council.

57.2 Any Branch may delegate the responsibility for deciding preference allocation to State Council.

57.3 The decision on the allocation of preferences for any electorate that is not a local government
municipality will be made by State Council or the body to which State Council delegates that
power, having consulted with the Branches to which the electorate corresponds.

#### Chapter 6 — Policy

##### 58 Overview

58.1 The purpose of this Chapter is to regulate the formation and drafting of policy for the political
purposes of the AGV. State Council may make bylaws to facilitate any element of the policy
process outlined hereunder.

58.2 Given that policy is particularly scrutinised during an electoral campaign, it will normally be
reviewed or developed in the period between elections. Reviews of current policies and
development of new policies may be initiated by decision of State Council or by a petition
supported by the signatures of at least 1 per cent or 50, whichever is the lesser, of AGV
members.

58.3 Policies which concern only one Branch area or region may be decided by an authorised Branch
or Regional Council responsible for that area, and must be consistent with state policy. Copies of
all policies adopted by a Branch or Regional Council will be forwarded immediately to the State
Secretary and to the convenor of the Policy Steering Committee.

58.4 State policies will be formulated with the maximum participation of the AGV Members through
the meeting procedures outlined in chapter 3.6, and should actively consider input from relevant
expert persons or bodies, including those external to the Party, and that provided by any elected
Greens public official.

##### 59 The Policy Steering Committee

59.1 The Policy Steering Committee is a Standing Committee of State Council. It is responsible to
State Council for the formulation and drafting of AGV policy.


59.2 The Policy Steering Committee is responsible for:

```
(a) management of the process of development and drafting of policy with state-wide cover;
(b) collaborating with the responsible Party bodies on the development and drafting of policy
with national scope, for recommendation to State Council for consideration of the National
Council of the Australian Greens in its policy approval process;
(c) reporting to State Council on all other matters referred to it by State Council; and
(d) any other policy-related functions given to it under the bylaws.
```
59.3 The Policy Steering Committee will establish a Quick Decision Making Group (QDMG) as
specified in section 50.

##### 60 The Policy Convenor

60.1 The Convenor of the Policy Steering Committee will be elected by all AGV Members by annual
postal or electronic ballot (though if the position remains unfilled after the annual postal or
electronic ballot for any reason, that position may be elected by all AGV Members present at the
Annual Conference or at a Special State Conference by consensus or, failing this consensus, by a
secret ballot of all AGV Members present), and will be a voting member of the State Executive
and State Council. An individual who has served two consecutive terms as Convenor will not be
eligible for re-election at the next election (but will in any case be eligible for subsequent
elections), unless this provision is waived by consensus decision of State Council.

60.2 The position of Convenor of the Policy Steering Committee may be held on a job-share basis, in
which case clauses 15.5, 15.6 and 15.7 shall apply as though ‘Office Bearers’ means ‘Convenors
of the Policy Steering Committee’ and ‘Executive’ means ‘Policy Steering Committee’, and
clause 15.9 will also apply.

60.3 The Convenor of the Policy Steering Committee will:

```
(a) be responsible for managing the meetings, agenda and responsibilities of the Committee in
a way which facilitates the effective delivery of the policy objectives of the AGV;
(b) convene urgent meetings of the Committee’s QDMG as required to address urgent and
pressing policy-related matters;
(c) attend whenever possible all meetings of the State Executive, to ensure policy
considerations are taken into account in all State Executive decisions;
(d) regularly report to the State Executive and State Council on the normal business of the
Committee, and refer Committee recommendations to the State Executive and State
Council for decision on actions where appropriate;
(e) liaise with any elected public officials, and facilitate their involvement in the policy
formulation process;
(f) confer with the Party bodies given responsibility for formulating the AGV position on
national policy matters; and
(g) perform any other function required by the bylaws.
```

##### 61 Formulation of Policy

61.1 Taking into account the advice of the Policy Steering Committee, State Council will make
bylaws regulating the process to be undertaken in formulating AGV policy. The bylaws will
include, but not be limited to:
(a) determining the establishment, role and responsibilities of working groups to develop
specific policy areas;
(b) establishing a process which ensures adequate input into the policy process by AGV
Members, Greens elected to public office and external experts; and
(c) establishing a process for reaching a consensus position (as far as that is possible) on draft
policy which is developed for State Council approval.

##### 62 Adoption of Policy

62.1 Subject to the appropriate notice periods and other requirements specified below, AGV policy
may be approved by a consensus decision of State Council, or by a 75 per cent majority vote of
State Council, or by a 75 per cent majority vote of AGV Members by postal or electronic ballot.

62.2 Where, at a State Council meeting, any policy or part of a policy is adopted, that policy will
become official policy immediately.

62.3 Notwithstanding clause 62.2, any whole or part of a policy or proposed policy will be subject to
a postal or electronic ballot of Members if:
(a) State Council determines that the policy or proposed policy will be subject to a postal or
electronic ballot; or
(b) within 28 days of consideration by State Council, 1 per cent or 50 (whichever is the lesser)
of AGV Members request in writing to the State Secretary that the policy or proposed
policy be subject to a postal or electronic ballot of AGV Members.

62.4 The result of a postal or electronic ballot to determine policy will be conclusive provided that 20
per cent of the eligible AGV Members voted, and at least 75 per cent of the valid votes cast are
in favour, and that policy will become official policy immediately.

62.5 If a postal or electronic ballot is to be conducted under clause 62.3, State Council will determine
what is put to the Members, including the question or questions that fairly represent the diversity
of views that have been expressed by Members at the State Council or State Conference.

62.6 Where such questions include policy proposals that are inconsistent in whole or in part with each
other, and where both policies receive at least 75 per cent of the valid votes cast, the policy that
obtains the greatest support will be adopted.

62.7 The State Council will not make any policy decision which contradicts any current policy of the
AGV approved by a ballot of AGV Members conducted as specified in clause 62.4, within the
life of the current parliamentary or local government term.

##### 63 Spokespersons

63.1 The only persons with authority to make public statements on behalf of the AGV are:

```
(a) the Convenor of the AGV;
(b) spokespersons appointed by the State Council;
```

```
(c) AGV Members in public office with the endorsement of the AGV; and
(d) AGV Members endorsed as candidates for public office with the endorsement of the AGV.

(k) may reopen any of the previous allegations to which sub-clause (j) refers that it decides
may form part of a pattern of behaviour;

allegations;
(m) must take into account previous Notices of Decision and Notices of Sanction regarding the
respondent when considering an appropriate sanction;

clause 89.13(a)(iv).

89.13 Subject to clause 89.14, regarding the whole or each part of the misconduct allegation, the Sub-

```
(iii) it was withdrawn by the applicant with the permission of the Sub-Panel; or

with it;

the Misconduct Panel notice in writing of the information required under clause 87.1(c).

89.16 A misconduct allegation (or part of it) dismissed under clause 89.13(a)(iv) is reinstated before

express consent in writing under clause 89.11(b).

```
(a) against a member for breaching a direction given or suspension imposed by the Sub-Panel

# SCHEDULE 1

1. Whereas at the time of the adoption of certain amendments to the Constitution which commenced in
    February 2012, there were a number of Branches in existence whose geographic jurisdiction did not
    correspond to one or more Local Government Area, the purpose of this Schedule is to:
       (a) ensure that within such Local Government Areas (only), either those Branches may continue
          or other arrangements as provided for in this Schedule are given effect; and
       (b) prescribe the representation of such Branches on State Council.
2. The Local Government Areas referred to in clause 1 of this Schedule are the City of Greater Geelong,
    the Borough of Queenscliffe and the Shire of Yarra Ranges. The Branches referred to in clause 1
    (being those which were in existence at the time of the amendments to the Constitution in February
    2012 and still in existence at the time of the inclusion of this Schedule in the Constitution) are
    Geelong and District, Bellarine, Dandenong Ranges, Healesville and Upper Yarra. These are referred
    to in this Schedule respectively as ‘Schedule 1 LGAs’ and ‘Schedule 1 Branches.’
3. Notwithstanding the terms of the Constitution, but subject to this Schedule, each Schedule 1 Branch
    shall continue in existence and shall have the same geographic jurisdiction (or such expanded
    jurisdiction as State Council may determine, but only for the purpose of ensuring that each AGV
    member within a Schedule 1 LGA is covered by the jurisdiction of a Schedule 1 Branch) unless and
    until that Branch votes to dissolve itself or lapses or is suspended in accordance with the Constitution
    and is not re-established within 12 months. Should such a Branch vote to merge with another Branch
    it may only do so if it amalgamates with another Branch or Branches in the same Schedule 1 LGA; or
    otherwise such that the resultant merged Branch corresponds to one or more Local Government Area.
4. Where a Schedule 1 Branch exists whose jurisdiction does not correspond to one or more Local
    Government Area, the representation on State Council of the relevant Branches by Branch
    Representatives will be such that the AGV members in each Schedule 1 LGA shall, if it has at least 15
    AGV members, elect one Branch Representative to State Council (including to a casual vacancy), in
    accordance with any by law enacted by State Council, or in default of such a by law, by a postal ballot
    of the relevant AGV Members conducted at the same time as elections for regional representatives.
5. Where the person or committee appointed by the State Executive is responsible for determining which
    Legislative Council region a Branch falls into for the purposes of State Council representation,
    Schedule 1 Branches which abut each other must all be assigned to the same Legislative Council
    region, which shall be the Legislative Council region that a plurality of members of the abutting
    Schedule 1 Branches reside within.
6. Whereas certain functions, powers and responsibilities are vested in a Branch under clauses:

```
(a) 24.1 (e) (replacing a State Council representative);
(b) 24.1 (h) (endorsing local government candidates);
(c) 55.2 (Branches being local government campaign committees);
(d) 56.4 (a) (local government pre-selection); and
(e) 57.1 (preferences in local government);
in the case of Branches within or partly within Schedule 1 LGAs, State Council may enact by laws
prescribing how such decisions may be made jointly by the relevant Schedule 1 Branches or by the
members of those Branches. In default of such by laws any decision which would otherwise be made
by a Branch corresponding to one or more Local Government Area may be made by concurrent
decisions of all the relevant Branches.
```

# THE CHARTER OF THE GREENS

We live at a crucial time in history. Never before have we had so many answers to the problems that have
dogged our developing world. Solutions now exist that could greatly decrease the poverty, hunger and ill-
health of our fellow humans and we now have technologies to reduce and repair much of the ecological
damage to our planet.

Clean air, clean water and ecological sustainability are possible. Yet this is not being achieved. World-
wide, governments lack the political will to make the necessary adjustments that will bring an end to the
conflict, pollution, poor health and social inequity that characterise our time.

The Greens have evolved in this climate to show a new way forward. A Green response to the ecological
crisis proceeds on the basis of a respect for all life, both human and non-human.

We recognise the mutual interdependence between humanity and the rest of nature and we seek to move
toward an ecologically sustainable path.

We seek to eradicate poverty, oppression and discrimination and to build a society underpinned by values
of participatory democracy, social justice, and the respect for cultural and ecological diversity. We aim to
transform the political, social and economic structures that disempower and oppress people and to
develop a rich, participatory cultural life that enables the flourishing of new democratic movements for
progressive change.

We believe that contesting elections is a necessary step toward the building of an ecologically sustainable
and socially just society, but that it is by no means the only step. We seek to encourage and facilitate
grassroots movements and community initiatives that are working towards ecological responsibility,
social justice, affirmative action and global equity. We seek to avoid parochialism and to cultivate a
global, ecological consciousness and a long- term perspective in order to safeguard the interests of both
existing and future generations and nonhuman species. We believe Australia should play an active role in
building a more co-operative world that is capable of addressing the glaring disparities in energy and
resource consumption and quality of life between rich and poor. We aim to extend recognition and
assistance to progressive social movements in other countries and to international institutions that are
working toward these ends.

Reflecting an awareness of the interrelatedness of all ecological, social and economic processes, the
general principles of the Greens are:

ECOLOGY:

    and the ecological resilience of life supporting systems.

1. to increase opportunities for public participation in political, social and economic decision-
    making.

    resources.
3. to adopt more comprehensive social, environmental and technology assessment practices.
4. to facilitate socially and ecologically responsible investment.

MEANINGFUL WORK:

1. to encourage, develop and assist work that is safe, fairly-paid, socially useful, personally fulfilling
    and not harmful to the environment.

    self-employment), on-going education, training and social welfare (including childcare) so that
    more people can engage in meaningful work.

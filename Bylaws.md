10. The State Returning Officer will ensure that where the implementation of any election requires the
    use of AGV office resources, measures are taken to ensure that the appropriate member of AGV staff

    those of any other election that may be occurring at the same time.

18. The Victorian Positions Document will be created in accordance with the following process.

    Victorian Positions Document must be explained to the National Conference during the first
    substantive discussion of the relevant matter.
26. All National Conference Representatives must attend meetings of a Victorian Delegates Caucus,

    the basis for the report to State Council of National Conference meetings.

    Victorian Positions Document and a decision of the Victorian Delegates Caucus must provide an
    explanation that blocking or vote at the next State Council meeting.

31. The Committee Convenor will be responsible for holding proxy votes for National Conference
    representatives who are not present at any given National Conference meeting, and proxy vote in
    accordance with the decisions of the Committee or the Victorian Delegates Caucus.
32. Should any National Conference representative position/s fall vacant, the Committee will appoint an
    acting National Conference representative as relevant to act until the next State Council meeting, at
    which point an election will be held for a replacement. The election will be open to all members.
33. If however the National Conference representative position/s fall vacant and there are respectively no
    National Council or Conference meetings scheduled between the time that the vacancy arises and
    the anticipated date of the Annual State Conference, the position will remain vacant until the Annual
    State Conference.

**Filling a Casual Vacancy for Regional Branch Representatives**

**Scope**

1. This section of the by-law is made under clause 40.7 of the Constitution.
2. Where a casual vacancy occurs for a Branch Representative State Councillor elected under clause
    40.2 (b) of the Constitution, i.e. elected from a Legislative Council region, the vacancy will be filled in
    accordance with this bylaw.

**Process to Fill the Vacancy**

3. If there is more than one vacancy, vacancies will be filled one at a time in accordance with the below.
4. The State Secretary will appoint two disinterested persons to determine which Branch in the
    Legislative Council region in question is the ‘most underrepresented’ by Branch Representatives.
5. In determining which Branch is ‘most underrepresented’, the two disinterested persons will be given
    access to a current database of members and will apply the following formula:
    a) For each Branch assigned to the Legislative Council region in question which has 15 or more
       members, a figure will be determined which is the number of members in that Branch divided by
       the number of currently serving Branch Representatives (both Branch-elected and regionally-
       elected under clauses 40.2 (a) and (b) of the Constitution respectively) registered as members
       of that Branch;
    b) The Branch with the highest figure will be determined to be the ‘most underrepresented’;
6. The Branch identified above will be notified by the State Secretary and may then appoint a Branch
    Representative to fill the casual vacancy.

1. This by-law elaborates the functions, powers and composition of the Victorian Campaign Committee
    (which shall be known as the Campaign Committee) and the Policy Steering Committee (which shall
    be known as the Policy Committee), the National Conference Committee, the Finance, Administration
    and Infrastructure Committee and the Membership Engagement Committee.

**Delegation of Powers in specific matter**

2. In addition to any specific power granted to any Standing Committee by the Constitution and this by-
    law, State Council or State Executive can, subject to such conditions as it thinks fit, delegate the
    making of any decision on a specifically defined matter within its power, to any Standing Committee
    or to two or more committees in which case the decision will require the agreement of each
    committee concerned. Such a decision is not considered merely procedural (i.e. it cannot be done
    merely be simple majority).
3. State Council or State Executive, and specifically the facilitator at the time such delegation is made,
    must ensure that the delegation is clearly defined and that the limits of the delegation are clear.
4. The terms of reference of each Standing Committee are deemed to include the delegation described
    in this section, but to avoid doubt, no delegation can be taken as including any power to change any
    By-law, and any such specific delegation (i.e. not included in the terms of reference) only operates for
    a specific period which must be defined in the delegation. Such a delegation may be made subject to
    such direction or condition as is specified.

**State Executive not to direct Committees but may stay decisions**

5. State Executive cannot direct any Standing Committee to make any particular decision and cannot
    direct its work (AGV Constitution Clause 46.8). However, State Executive may request a Standing
    Committee to review a decision, and may determine to put a stay on any decision of any Standing
    Committee, or part of a decision, pending the next State Council, or for such shorter time as it
    determines.
6. In addition, wherever it appears to an Office Bearer or to the Convenor of a Standing Committee that
    two or more Standing Committees have made inconsistent decisions, or that a Standing Committee
    has acted outside its power the Executive may resolve the matter by making its own decision (except
    where this would involve the Executive making Policy), or otherwise acting beyond its powers (AGV
    Constitution Clause 46.5).

**When a Standing Committee is to make a decision and when it is to make a**

**recommendation**


General Operations of Standing Committees By-law - Version 20 19 - 08 - 15 Page **28** of **106**

```

```
7. It is the intention of State Council that wherever the State Council has delegated to a Standing
    Committee under this by-law or otherwise, the power to make a decision (as opposed to State
    Council merely delegating a power to make a recommendation), then in the normal course of events
    it is expected that the Standing Committee will make decisions about these matters and will not
    merely make recommendations.
8. Therefore, there should be unusual circumstances why a Standing Committee only makes a
    recommendation where it could make a decision. Such circumstances might include the importance
    of the matter in the particular context, or the level of controversy about the matter in the Party.
9. It is the intention of State Council that wherever the State Council has delegated to a Standing
    Committee under its terms of reference, the power to make a recommendation, then in the normal
    course of events it is expected that the Standing Committee will make recommendations which do not
    require a further decision of the State Council, other than mere approval of the recommendation
10. If Standing Committee is of the view that an issue should be an item for discussion at State Council,
    this does not of itself mean it should fail to make a substantive recommendation, but the Committee
    may request the Secretary that the item be listed for discussion.

**Quorum and QDMG**

11. The provisions regarding quorum, QDMG and election of general members do not apply to the
    National Conference Committee.
12. The quorum for a meeting of a Standing Committee shall be at least half of its members. However
    quorum for the Finance Administration Infrastructure and Staffing Committee must also include any of
    the State Secretary, the State Assistant Secretary or the State Treasurer.
13. Each Standing Committee shall appoint a Quick Decision Making Group, which must have four
    members and must include at least one of the office bearers (or if no office bearer is a member of the
    Committee, at least one member of the State Executive). A decision by a QDMG must be supported
    by at least 3 members and must not be opposed by any member of the QDMG, and must be ratified
    in the minutes and Record of Decisions at the next meeting.

**Election of General members of Standing Committees**

14. General members of Standing Committees shall be elected by a postal or electronic ballot of all
    members prior to State Conference.
15. Any casual vacancy on a Standing Committee shall be filled by State Council at its next meeting, by
    election from among the members of the Party, provided that State Council may delegate the filling of
    such vacancy to the Executive if insufficient nominations are received.

**Removal of General members of Standing Committees**

16. A member of a Standing Committee (other than a person who holds that position by virtue of holding
    another office, but including any Policy Sub-Committee) may resign in writing to the Convenor of the
    Standing Committee or to the State Secretary.
17. Wherever a member of a Standing Committee (other than a person who holds that position by virtue
    of holding another office):
    a) fails to attend two consecutive meetings without apology; or
    b) fails to attend three meetings with apologies (excluding exceptional circumstances where leave
       of absence is granted from the Committee for not more than three months); or
    c) is found to have committed misconduct; or
    d) appears to be unable or unwilling to contribute to the work of the Committee;
    The Convenor of the Committee will contact that member to discuss their continued membership of
    the Committee. Should the member not resign and should the Convenor after that discussion not be
    satisfied about the continued involvement of that member, the Convenor of the Committee will, as he

```
or she considers appropriate, recommend to the State Executive in writing (with a copy to the
member) that the member’s position be declared vacant, and the State Executive may upon this
recommendation remove the member from the Standing Committee, provided the member has been
afforded an opportunity to be heard. This is subject to review by State Council should the member
challenge the decision.
```
18. Under no other circumstances and for no other reason shall the State Executive have the power to
    remove a member of a Standing Committee, but State Council may do so at its discretion provided an
    opportunity has been afforded to the Standing Committee member to be heard prior to any such
    decision being made.

**Office Bearers**

19. A Standing Committee Convenor will be responsible for:

```
a) facilitating meetings of the Committee, or delegating this responsibility to another member for
any meeting;
b) in conjunction with the Secretary, ensuring that the appropriate notice of meeting, agenda and
motions on notice are provided in good time;
c) ensuring that the business of each Committee meeting is properly addressed;
d) presenting Committee reports to the State Council;
e) acting as the Committee’s primary point of contact with State Office Bearers and State
Councillors, except where decided otherwise by the Committee;
f) in consultation with the State Secretary, corresponding with the National Office Bearers on
behalf of the Committee.
```
20. All Standing Committees shall be required to appoint a Secretary at their first meeting after each AGV
    Annual State Conference or as vacancies arise.
21. A Standing Committee Secretary shall be charged with:

```
a) in conjunction with the Convenor, ensuring that the appropriate notice of meeting, agenda and
motions on notice are provided in good time;
b) in combination with the Convenor, the creation of meeting agendas;
c) the taking of meeting minutes;
d) the uploading of these minutes to the internal AGV website within one week of each meeting;
e) liaising with the Returning Officers to ensure that any Committee vacancies are addressed; and
f) maintaining any e-lists of the Committee.
```
**Meetings**

22. Standing Committees are required to establish and publish on the internal AGV website a meeting
    schedule early in their terms. Any changes to the schedule are to be advised to State Council.
23. A Standing Committee will meet as needed, but not less than four times a year, to carry out its duties.
24. Wherever possible, at least one week’s notice will be given of all meetings of the Standing
    Committee.
25. Urgent meetings may be called if required but not with less than 24 hours’ notice.
26. A Standing Committee will not make decisions except at meetings or by Quick Decision.
27. Standing Committee attendance records must be kept and displayed on the internal AGV website,
    and reported to each Annual State Conference.

```
**Scope**

1. The Constitution of the AGV provides for the establishment of an Electoral and Continuous
    Campaigning Committee in Section 53. This By-law governs the operation of that Committee.

**Functions**

2. The name of the Committee shall be the Campaign Committee, but it may also be cited as the
    Electoral and Continuous Campaigning Committee.
3. The functions of the Campaign Committee include those set out in the Constitution, as follows:

```
53.1. Reporting to State Council, the formulation of state-wide AGV electoral and
continuous campaigning policy and the management of its application will be the
responsibility of the Electoral and Continuous Campaigning Committee created as
a Standing Committee of State Council under this Chapter.
53.2. The Electoral and Continuous Campaigning Committee is responsible for:
a. developing electoral and continuous campaigning policy with state-wide
cover for local government and state parliamentary elections, and
managing such campaigns;
b. liaising with regional electoral and continuous campaigning committees and
Branches to facilitate the goals of this Chapter;
c. collaborating with relevant Party bodies to develop national electoral and
continuous campaigning policy;
d. reporting to State Council on all other matters referred to it by State
Council;
```
4. Without limiting the operation of clause 3 above, the Committee is responsible for the general
    management of electoral and related campaigns within the resources allocated to it by State Council
    or otherwise; and for the implementation of:
    a) Applicable decisions of State Council regarding State electoral and related campaign matters;
    b) Applicable decisions of Branches and Regions and of State Council in respect of local
       government elected and related campaigns;
    c) Applicable decisions of State Council and the Australian Greens in respect of national electoral
       and related campaigns;
    but not so as to give it control over the resources of any other Party body.
5. The Committee must recommend to State Council for adoption, a Campaign Strategy Statement, of
    no more than 500 words, that covers a nominated prospective period, and which is to include (but
    need not be limited to):

```
a) Strategic objectives;
b) priority policy issues;
c) the general approach to the content and method of campaigning;
d) approaches to organisational and communication questions;
e) Lessons from past experience; and
f) How the strategy will maximise the participation of party members.
```
6. Wherever State Council adopts a campaign Strategy Statement, the campaign Committee must in
    performing its functions be guided by that Statement, or if it departs from that guidance, must note
    that in its minutes and report this to the next State Council.
7. Prior to the expiry of the period covered by a campaign strategy statement, the Committee must
    recommend and present to State Council a further Strategy Statement.
8. Except on a pro-tem basis with the approval of the State Executive, and subject to such conditions as
    the State Executive may prescribe in any circumstance, the Campaign Committee may only authorise
    expenditure pursuant to a budget approved by State Council, after its consideration by the Standing
    Committee responsible for Finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, total expenditure may exceed
    that provided for in the budget provided that (and only provided that);
    a) the Standing Committee responsible for Finance, on the recommendation of the Treasurer; or
       the Executive; has approved this increase on the basis of a determining that there is sufficiently
       certain basis to increase a corresponding income or revenue budget line within the Committee’s
       budget; or
    b) the Executive has allocated other funds to cover the increase in expenditure.
9. When a budget has been approved by State Council, the Campaign Committee may amend the
    budget provided that the following conditions are met:
    a) there is no increase in total expenditure (except as provided for in 6 above);
    b) any proposal to reduce an allocation of the funds to be controlled by to any Branch, Regional
       Council, Branch-based or Region-based election campaign committee, as compared to the
       budget approved by State Council or any amended budget approved by the Committee, must
       not occur unless the Convenor or (if the Convenor appears to be unavailable) some other
       appropriate person from each of these bodies has been invited to the meeting and given the
       opportunity to be heard; and the reduction has then been then approved by the State Executive;
       and no such reduction shall have effect if any such body would be unable to meet its
       commitments solely because of such a reduction.
    c) Any such amendment is not contrary to any decision of State Council (other than the decision to
       adopt the budget itself)
10. Wherever it appears to the Convenor of the Campaign Committee or to the Treasurer, that in
    connection with an election, there will be significant additional funds available to spend on campaign
    related expenditure in connection with that election then, subject only to there being sufficient time
    available before the relevant election having regard to the urgency of making decisions, the
    Campaign Committee shall, prior to allocating such additional funds, the Convenor or (if the
    Convenor appears to be unavailable) some other appropriate person from each Branch, Regional
    Council, Branch-based or Region-based election campaign committee having responsibility for the
    conduct of a relevant election, shall been invited to any meeting which is to consider that allocation,
    and shall be given the opportunity to be heard.
11. In addition to any other obligations under this bylaw, the Campaign Committee must not less than
    once every four months, and;
    a) within ten days of the dissolution of the State or Federal Parliament (or a House thereof);
    b) between 4 and 6 weeks prior to a date on which local government elections are to be generally
       held across the state;

```
hold a meeting of the Campaign Committee to which all the Convenors or (if the Convenor appears to
be unavailable) some other appropriate person from each Branch, Regional Council, Branch-based
or Region-based election campaign committee having responsibility for the conduct of a relevant
election campaign shall been invited to that meeting. Such a meeting may be held in conjunction with
any special meeting of State Council held because of the calling of an election.
```
12. The Campaign Committee is responsible for determining the pre-selection process for Senate pre-
    selection and for directing the implementation of that process. Moreover, the Campaign Committee
    has the responsibility to ensure that other party bodies are carrying out pre-selection decisions, and
    for settling the date by which such decisions must be taken. Where it appears that the situation
    requires it, the Campaign Committee may do any act or thing necessary, or authorise a person to do
    any act or thing to ensure that there is a candidate for a specific State or Commonwealth
    parliamentary election, in circumstances where:
    a) A decision has been made that the Party is to have such a candidate;
    b) For any reason no candidate has been selected, or a candidate has been selected and for any
       reason is no longer to be the candidate; and
    c) Under the relevant procedures applicable, it is not reasonably practicable for the Party to select
       a candidate, and the relevant Branches and campaign committees are consulted.
13. The Campaign Committee is responsible within its powers, for ensuring that campaign
    communication infrastructure is effective.
14. By force of this By-law, and subject to any specific decision made from time to time by State Council,
    State Council delegates its powers under Sections 56.1, 56.2, 56.5 and 56.8 (Preselection
    Processes), to the Campaign Committee.

**Composition**

15. The Campaign Committee shall in “full session” consist of:

```
a) The Committee Convenor.^1
b) Three general members elected for a term of up to two years which may be expressed as a
period of time or as related to an event (for example, until two months after the next federal
election), as determined by State Council from time to time (or in default of a decision, one
year).
c) The State Treasurer, or if the Executive so decides, the Assistant State Treasurer.
d) One member each of the Parliamentary Membership of the party (if any) at State and Federal
level nominated by each of the relevant party leaders or failing that agreed between the
relevant (Victorian) members in each case; or a nominee of each State and Federal group of
parliamentarians, for a term of office determined by the relevant parliamentary group, not being
less than one year.
e) A party member who is or has been a local government councillor, selected by the current
Greens local government councillors, for a term of office decided by them, not being less than
one year.
f) The most senior staff member of the AGV, who shall not have a vote.
g) Up to three members nominated by the Campaign Committee from time to time (after general
advertisement to party members), selected by the committee having regard to ensuring the
inclusion on the committee of a balance of members with necessary expertise, knowledge or
experience.
```
16. The persons holding office on the Campaign Committee under Clause 15, Part “d” above shall not
    have the right to vote if they are on the Campaign Committee in their capacity as a staff member of

(^1) The procedure for the election of the Convenor of the Campaign Committee is outlined in Clause 54.1 of the AGV State
Constitution and is a ballot of all members of the AGV.

```
the party or a politician, and subject to direction in the performance of their work by the Party or a
politician.
```
17. Each of the following persons shall have the right to attend, and shall be advised of meeting times
    and agendas, if not otherwise a member of the Campaign Committee:
    a) The Party Office Bearers
    b) The Convenor of the Policy Committee
    c) Each of the nine members of State Council mentioned in Section 40.5 of the AGV State
       Constitution.
    d) AGV delegates to any national campaign committees or national campaign working groups

**Campaign Management Team**

18. The Campaign Committee may also meet in the form of the Campaign Management Committee,
    which shall consist of :
    a) The Convenor the Campaign Committee (or if the Convenor is unable to attend, they may
       nominate one of the two members of the Campaign Committee elected by State Council to
       attend in their place);
    b) The most senior member of the AGV staff.
    c) Between 2 and 4 AGV members appointed by the Campaign Committee from time to time.
19. The quorum for the Campaign Committee shall be at least half of its members.
20. The State Party Convenor, if not otherwise a member, shall be entitled to be advised of a meeting of
    the Campaign Management Committee, and shall be entitled to attend or to appoint a member of the
    State Executive to attend in their place. The State Party Treasurer shall be entitled to attend and
    advised of the time of meetings. The most senior member of the AGV staff acts as the Secretary of
    the Campaign Management Committee.
21. The Campaign Management Committee shall have all the powers of the Full session Campaign
    Committee, except the following:
    a) Amending the Campaign Committee budget to increase total expected expenditure;
    b) Reducing the allocation in the budget to any Branch, Regional Council, Branch-based or
       Region-based election campaign committee having responsibility for the conduct of a relevant
       election;
    c) Acting in a manner inconsistent with an explicit decision or direction of the Campaign
       Committee;
    d) Exercising any of the delegated powers of State Council under Section 56 of the Constitution.
22. In performing their functions, each of the Campaign Committee (full session) and the Campaign
    Management Group shall be mindful of the intention of State Council in establishing these two
    bodies:
    a) In many circumstances, the day to day political pronouncements of the Party are necessarily
       those of the Party’s elected representatives, and there should be maximum co-operation
       between the Committee and those representatives. Nevertheless, the campaign resources of
       the Party should at all times be directed in support of positions consistent with Party policy, and
       the Campaign Committee has a responsibility to ensure this is the case.
    b) The Campaign Committee’s (in full session) primary functions are the recommendation to State
       Council of overall strategy, ensuring that strategy is being implemented, amending strategy
       when necessary, financial compliance, budget management, selection of major contractors
       such as advertising agencies, proper governance, and effective communication within the
       Party. While it will be required to exercise its political authority where controversy arises within
       the Party about day to day management issues, the Campaign Committee oversees but does

```
not participate in the day to day management of Campaign issues. In light of this, it would be
expected that the Campaign Committee would meet monthly, and more often during an election
campaign period.
c) The Campaign Management Group is responsible to the Campaign Committee in full session
for making day-to decisions about the content of campaigns and the allocation of resources
under the control of the Campaign Committee. It would be convened by the Campaign
Committee Convenor whenever the need arises, and it would be expected to meet at least
several times each week during an election campaign period. It must report all of its decisions
to the Campaign Committee and these must be included in the minutes of the next Campaign
Committee meeting. The Campaign Management Group can direct the day-to-day priorities of
the Campaign Staff through the most senior staff member.

**Scope and purpose**

1. This bylaw gives effect to clause 55.5 of the Constitution.

**Jurisdiction and Review of Standing Electorate Campaign**

**Committees**

2. The State Executive will appoint a person or establish a committee prior to 31 January in each year,
    which will be responsible for drafting a proposal (the draft report) to determine the number and
    jurisdiction of standing electorate campaign committees in accordance with this bylaw. The person or
    committee may be the same as that appointed under clause 14.1 of the Constitution.
3. The person or committee will receive all necessary support from AGV constituent groups, to enable that
    person or committee to present the draft report to the State Executive by 30 April in each year.
4. The person or committee will, by 14 April, set out as part of the draft report:

```
a) Each Victorian Legislative Assembly and House of Representatives lower house electorate with its
newest boundaries (i.e. current boundaries or boundaries gazetted which will take effect at the next
general election, whichever are newer), and whether each electorate will or will not be governed by
a standing electorate campaign committee. In doing so, the person or committee will set out in the
case of each electorate:
i) Whether it does not fall wholly or partly within the jurisdiction of a Branch, and therefore
clause 55.4 (b) of the Constitution applies; or
ii) Whether it falls wholly or partly within the jurisdiction of a Branch, and therefore clause 55.4
(a) of the Constitution applies, and:
(1) It is an electorate where on the best information available the person or committee
appointed under clause 2 above understands that all Branches in existence with
coverage of that electorate have decided that there should not be a standing electorate
campaign committee, including past decisions which have not been superseded, in
which case there will be no standing electorate campaign committee; or
(2) All circumstances other than described in sub clause (1) above, in which case there will
be a standing electorate campaign committee.
b) Key information about each standing electorate campaign committee. In doing so, the person or
committee will set out in the case of each standing electorate campaign committee:
i) Its name (which will usually take the form “[Electorate/s] State ECC” or “[Electorate/s] Federal
ECC”);
```

```
```
ii) The electorate/s it covers (a committee can cover up to 3 State electorates or up to 2 Federal
electorates (but not a combination of State and Federal electorates) if on the best information
available the Branches in the relevant areas wish it to be the case, or if the pre-existing
structure has allowed for it, otherwise there will be one committee per electorate. Where there
is an incumbent Greens MP or by a decision of State Council including through the adoption
of a campaign strategy identifying priority or winnable electorates, there will be one
committee per electorate);
iii) Based on the report provided to the State Executive under clause 14.5 of the Constitution, the
number of representatives each Branch is entitled to appoint as member of the committee,
such that:
(1) If there is only one Branch which falls wholly or partly within the jurisdiction of the
committee, that Branch shall be entitled to appoint 4 or 5 representatives;
(2) If there are two or three Branches which fall wholly or partly within the jurisdiction of the
committee there will be six Branch representatives in total.
(3) If there are four or more Branches which fall wholly or partly within the jurisdiction of the
committee there will be seven Branch representatives in total.
(4) The number of positions appointed by each Branch will be as closely as possible
consistent with that Branch’s proportion of the membership in the relevant electorate(s),
provided that then, without increasing the number, any Branch without a representative
will be allocated one. Where any Branch entitled to one representative has advised that
it does not wish to appoint such a representative, the number of positions determined in
this clause will not take into account such a Branch.
iv) Whether the committee is currently suspended under clause 55.9 of the Constitution and
when the suspension is to be lifted, if known.
```
5. The person or committee will then:

```
a) Forward the draft report to all Branches, existing standing electorate campaign committees and the
Victorian Campaign Committee for comment, not less than 14 days before its scheduled
consideration by the State Executive;
b) Consider comments on the draft report which are received not less than 7 days before the draft
proposal’s scheduled consideration by the State Executive, and any other comments as it chooses;
and
c) Provide to the State Executive an updated draft report incorporating any amendments which are
necessary due to the identification of any errors or due to new information being disclosed in
relation to clauses 4(a) or 4(b). Other comments received which did not result in amendment/s will
be attached to the updated draft report.
```
6. Upon receiving the updated draft report the State Executive will, by 30 April, either: endorse it; or
    amend it to reflect comments made, including those made by a Branch, existing standing electorate
    campaign committee or the Victorian Campaign Committee, or to correct any error.
7. Upon endorsing the report and by 7 May, the State Executive will release the endorsed draft report (the
    final report) to State Council members, Branches, existing standing electorate campaign committees
    and members of the Victorian Campaign Committee, and the findings of the final report will come into
    effect and be binding as at 1 July. If there is an objection to the decision made by the State Executive
    under this clause, the State Executive may refer a matter to the State Council if it considers
    appropriate, or may vary its own decision.
8. By 14 May, the State Secretary or delegate will write to all office bearers of Branches and existing
    standing electorate campaign committees within the jurisdiction of each standing electorate campaign
    committee which will come into (or have continuing) effect as at 1 July and which is not suspended,
    setting out the name, jurisdiction, powers, responsibilities and membership structure of the committee,
    so as to ensure that Branches and existing standing electorate campaign committees are specifically
    aware of any changes to campaign structures and are reminded of Branch representative appointment
    entitlements.

f) Any AGV Member the committee decides to co-opt, including:
i) Persons with the responsibility of liaising with other campaign committees operating in the
same area, for example a Local Government election campaign committee established by a
Branch. Such persons will be non-voting members;
ii) One member from a Branch which falls partly or wholly within the electorates overseen by the
committee, if the Branch is not already represented on the committee (that is, a Branch which
had a resolution that it did not wish to appoint such a representative which was current at the
time of determination of the report under clause 7, but where that Branch has later resolved
that it does with to appoint such a representative). Such a person will be a voting member;
iii) Any member of the campaign management team, if one has been established, who is not
otherwise a member of the committee. Such a person will be a non-voting member; and
iv) Any other person to complement the skills of existing committee members. Such persons will
be non-voting members.
```
13. Branch representatives will be elected by their Branches from time to time such that:

```
a) If a Branch has not had a general election for its fully entitled number of Branch representatives on
the committee since its previous Annual General Meeting, a fresh election for all the Branch’s
representatives must be held at the Annual General Meeting; and
b) A Branch may fill any casual vacancy for one or more of its representatives at any time.
```
14. Branch representatives are expected to report committee activities and decisions to their Branches and
    to communicate the expectations of their Branches to the committee.
15. A Branch representative member may be removed at any time by a Branch, or by a two-thirds majority
    vote of a standing electorate campaign committee, upon which the Branch may appoint a new
    representative.
16. Standing electorate campaign committees will appoint office bearers, being a Convenor (or co-
    Convenors), a Secretary (or co- Secretaries) and a Treasurer (or co-Treasurers), on an annual basis at
    their first meeting after 1 July, or at the next general meeting of the committee where there is any
    vacancy in any office.
17. The Convenor (or co-Convenors) shall be responsible, among other things, to facilitate meetings or
    appoint meeting facilitators, be the main contact person/s for the committee and provide the Victorian
    Campaign Committee with written reports on the activity of the standing electorate campaign committee
    as and when requested.
18. The Secretary (or co-Secretaries) shall be responsible, among other things, to provide notice of
    meetings and prepare and distribute meeting agendas after consulting the Convenor, and prepare and
    distribute meeting minutes, keep a record of all committee correspondence and other documentation,
    and provide the AGV State Secretary with any committee documentation requested.
19. The Treasurer (or co-Treasurers) shall be responsible, among other things, to lead the committee’s

```
member has been employed to undertake this role), lead the committee’s financial management and
record keeping work (except where a staff member has been employed to undertake this role), and
provide the AGV State Treasurer with any committee documentation requested.
```
20. The standing electorate campaign committee will choose one of its members to be the campaign co-
    ordinator for the purposes of clause 55.7 of the Constitution. This will normally be an office bearer or a
    staff member employed to work with the committee.

**Meetings of Standing Electorate Campaign Committees**

21. Quorum of any meeting of any standing electorate campaign committee shall be a majority of all voting
    members appointed as at the date of the meeting, or 3, whichever is more.
22. Standing electorate campaign committees will meet at least once per year, and:

```
a) If the committee covers a State electorate/s, at least quarterly during the 12 months preceding a
State general election; or
b) If the committee covers a Federal electorate/s, at least quarterly during the period between two
years following a Federal general election and the next Federal election.
```
23. Where the date for the next meeting has not been set in advance by a meeting of a standing electorate
    campaign committee, the committee Secretary, after consulting the Convenor, shall be responsible for
    advertising the next meeting with at least five days notice. Meetings may be called with less than five
    days notice if the Convenor and Secretary can reasonably establish an urgent reason to do so.

**Transitionary Provisions Upon Dissolution or Change of Jurisdiction**

**of Standing Electorate Campaign Committees**

24. Where, in advance of 1 July of any year and in accordance with the report endorsed and released by
    the Executive under clause 7 a standing electorate campaign committee is anticipated either to be
    dissolved or to change its jurisdiction in a way which alters the Branch representative makeup of the
    committee (i.e. different Branch/es will fall within the committee’s jurisdiction and/or Branch
    representative entitlements change), the committee will, by 30 June, attempt to decide how any funds
    or other resources held by the committee will be redistributed. Any decision on this question must be by
    consensus, and any funds held by the committee may not be transferred to a Branch except with the
    permission of the Finance, Administration and Infrastructure Committee. Where any committee has
    failed to reach consensus on this question, the State Executive may determine the fair redistribution of
    any funds held by the committee.
25. Where, in advance of 1 July of any year, a standing electorate campaign committee is anticipated to
    materially change its jurisdiction (i.e. different Branch/es will fall within the committee’s jurisdiction) in
    accordance with the report endorsed and released by the Executive under clause 7, Branches should
    elect their representatives to the post 1 July committees as soon as practicable after the release of the
    report.

**Special Provisions in the event of redistributions**

26. The State Executive may, if it deems that clause 4 (a) will not adequately allow for Standing Electorate
    Campaign Committees to be formed on newly gazetted boundaries of electorates within the relevant 12
    month period, establish a process to review the scope and jurisdiction of Standing Electorate Campaign
    Committees affected by the gazetted new boundaries following the redistribution.
27. Any review under clause 26 must have its parameters determined by the Executive, and generally be
    consistent, where relevant, with clauses 2 to 8 of this bylaw, disregarding the time period requirements.

**Interpretational Issues**

28. Wherever this bylaw provides for a Branch to provide advice to another body or person, or to agree or
    not agree to any act matter or thing, that body or person shall be entitled to rely upon written advice (or
    agreement, etc.) from the relevant Branch Secretary or Convenor as representing the Branch’s position.

Note: excerpts or descriptions of the State Constitution are shaded in grey and are for reference only; such
references do not themselves constitute Standing Orders.

**Purpose**

1. The Standing Orders, along with the State Constitution, are the principal source of procedural
    authority for meetings of State Council. All meetings of State Council are to be conducted within the
    framework provided by these Standing Orders. Adherence to these Standing Orders is required for
    the proper conduct of State Council meetings.

**Agenda**

The agenda is set by the State Secretary in line with the State Constitution and by-laws.

2. The agenda will specify the order and substance of matters for reporting or for debate.
3. The agenda will include the full text of any and all Proposals (see Standing Orders: Proposals).
4. The State Secretary may in framing the Agenda list a matter for “Discussion” or for “Formal Decision
    or Approval”. The agenda will include the words “For report only” or “Formal Decision or Approval” at
    agenda items where it is proposed that no discussion be entered into.
5. The name of the facilitator for any and all parts of any State Council meeting will appear in the
    agenda. The facilitator will be the State Convenor, or appointee of the State Convenor.
6. The agenda will specify that the beginning of each meeting will, before any substantive matters are
    discussed, include:
    a) an acknowledgement of traditional landowners;
    b) a reminder of the party’s Code of Conduct and complaints process and the contact person for
       that meeting;

```
```
c) a determination by the facilitator of whether or not the meeting is quorate (see Standing Orders:
Quorum);
d) a declaration of observers;
e) a report of State Councillors absent with apologies;
f) the Proposal “that the proposed agenda and facilitators be agreed to”. To this Proposal, State
Councillors may propose amendments to:
i. select different facilitators for any particular agenda item;
ii. add agenda items;
iii. add or delete the words “For report only” as appropriate to any part of the agenda;
iv. move any items marked “For Formal Decision or Approval” to items for discussion; or
v. propose a variation to the time allocation;
g) a moment where the facilitator will ask State Councillors to disclose any material personal
interest they have in relation to any scheduled agenda item. State Councillors must disclose
any material personal interest in relation to any matter being considered at this point or as soon
as they become aware of their interest in the matter. Any disclosure must:
i. give details of the nature and extent of the interest;
ii. give details of the relation of the interest to the matter being considered; and
iii. be recorded in the minutes, with brief details.
Any State Councillor who has a material person interest must not be present, block consensus
or vote while the relevant matter is being considered, and must disclose the nature and extent
of their interest in the matter at the next State Conference.
```
**Quorum**

41.4 A quorum for a State Council meeting will be the next integer greater than one third the number of
voting members of the State Council for the time being.

7. The facilitator will determine whether State Council is quorate at the beginning of every meeting. No
    decision of State Council is valid unless the facilitator has declared that the meeting is quorate.
8. State Council is deemed to be quorate until the meeting is closed by the facilitator, except if any State
    Councillor draws the attention of the facilitator to a possible lack of quorum at any time during a
    meeting, whereupon the facilitator will count State Councillors present to determine whether or not
    the meeting is still quorate.

**Discussion**

9. The facilitator will allow discussion at any point in the agenda where the words “For report only” or
    “For Formal Decision or Approval” do not appear. State Councillors should refrain from seeking
    recognition to speak during times that the facilitator has not opened discussion unless there is good
    reason to do so.
10. A State Councillor wishing to speak must indicate and be recognised by the facilitator before
    speaking.
11. If two or more State Councillors seek recognition to speak, the facilitator will keep a list and allow any
    State Councillor making a proposal to speak first and take any questions from the floor, and
    thereafter recognise State Councillors in the order in which recognition was sought. The facilitator will
    be flexible with the order of recognition of speakers (for example, in the interests of affirmative action
    or to ensure the maximum participation of all involved or to allow for discussion of different views).
12. The facilitator may choose to allow observers to address the meeting. If so, the above will apply.


Standing Orders of State Council By-Law - Version 2019- 09 - 19 Page **57** of **106**

```
Please consider the environment before you print this document. Choose eco-friendly paper stock. Reduce paper usage by sharing with someone
```
13. The facilitator will have the right to speak at any time. Minimal discussion on substantive matters will
    be entered into by the meeting facilitator.
14. The facilitator will close discussion when the time allotted for the agenda item has expired. An
    extension of time will only be permitted if a procedural question is agreed to (see Standing Orders:
    Procedural Questions).

**Order**

15. State Councillors will at all times during meetings adhere to the Code of Conduct and also:

```
a) respect the authority of the facilitator to facilitate debates and maintain order; and
b) adhere to requests from the facilitator for silence at any point.
```
16. A point of order may be raised with the facilitator by any State Councillor at any time if the State
    Councillor believes the standing orders are being breached. After the point of order has been raised
    with the facilitator, debate on all other matters will be suspended until the facilitator has addressed
    the matter.
17. If the facilitator deems the frequency or substance of points of order from any one State Councillor to
    be deliberately vexatious, that State Councillor must abide by any request of the facilitator to cease
    raising points of order for a period of time stated by the facilitator.

**Decision-making Process**

18. Every proposed decision of State Council will:

```
a) begin with the word “that”;
b) be recorded in the minutes; and
c) have the outcome recorded in the minutes in the terms “agreed to” or “not agreed to”.
```
19. For the purposes of the Standing Orders, all proposed decisions before State Council will be
    classified in one of two ways:
    a) proposals relating to substantive matters (see below); or as
    b) procedural questions relating to procedure (see below).

**Proposals**

20. Proposals are important questions of substance (not procedure) to which the principles of consensus
    decision-making will be fully applied.
21. Proposals will only be considered if:

```
a) they appear in the agenda; or
b) a procedural question to allow consideration is agreed to (Standing Orders: Procedural
Questions); or
c) a workshop held earlier during the meeting has constructed a Proposal that is directly relevant
to the agenda item.
```
22. Proposals will be written.
23. Proposals will be numbered, with numbering beginning at 1 at the beginning of each new agenda
    item.
24. Proposals will be minuted consistently as follows:

```
a) If a Proposal is dealt with in the usual way:
i. PROPOSAL [number]: that [text of proposal in full].
ii. PROPOSAL [number] [not] agreed to.
b) If a Proposal lapses:
```

Standing Orders of State Council By-Law - Version 2019- 09 - 19 Page **58** of **106**

```
Please consider the environment before you print this document. Choose eco-friendly paper stock. Reduce paper usage by sharing with someone
```
```
i. PROPOSAL [number]: that [text of proposal in full].
ii. A procedural question, “that the proposal lapse”, was agreed to.
iii. PROPOSAL [number] lapsed.
c) If a Proposal is deferred:
i. PROPOSAL [number]: that [text of proposal in full].
ii. A procedural question, “that the Proposal be considered at [a later time this day / the
next meeting]”, was agreed to.
iii. PROPOSAL [number] deferred.
d) If a Proposal is put to a vote as required by a procedural question being agreed to:
i. PROPOSAL [number]: that [text of proposal in full].
ii. PROPOSAL [number] not agreed to.
iii. A procedural question “that the proposal be put to a vote” was agreed to.
iv. PROPOSAL [number] was put to a vote and was [not] agreed to ([number] Ayes;
[number] Noes; [number] Abstentions).
```
48.3 A substantive motion carried by vote, unless provided for elsewhere in the Constitution, requires at
least a 75 per cent majority of votes cast. Abstentions may be recorded but will not count as a vote, either
for or against

**Amendments to Proposals**

25. Amendments to Proposals will, if longer than ten words, be written.
26. Amendments will be determined by consensus or, if required, by straw poll (50% +1 required to
    carry).
27. If an amendment is accepted, the original Proposal as amended, becomes the substantive Proposal,
    otherwise the original Proposal stands.
28. Further amendments, if any, will be dealt with sequentially as above, provided that:

```
a) amendments to amendments (other than grammatical improvements) will not be permitted; and
b) concurrent consideration of two or more amendments will not be permitted.
```
29. When all amendments raised have been determined, the substantive Proposal (as amended or not)
    is put for determination by the meeting according to normal decision making procedures.

**Procedural questions**

30. Procedural questions are administrative in nature and must be dealt with immediately once raised.
31. Procedural questions may be raised by any State Councillor at any time. If the facilitator deems the
    frequency or substance of procedural questions from any one State Councillor to be deliberately
    vexatious, that State Councillor must abide by any request of the facilitator to cease raising
    procedural questions for a period of time stated by the facilitator.
32. Once a procedural question is raised by a State Councillor, that State Councillor may briefly state a
    reason for raising it and the facilitator must then immediately ask State Councillors if there is any
    dissent to the procedural question being agreed to. Following this:
    a) if there is no dissent, the procedural question is agreed to; or
    b) if there is dissent, the facilitator may allow the reasons for dissent to be stated briefly, then must
       ask for a show of hands of State Councillors. A simple majority is required for the procedural
       question to be agreed to, with the exception of the procedural questions to put a proposal to a
       vote or to suspend Standing Orders, which require a 75% super majority for the procedural
       question to be agreed to.

```
33. Procedural questions will only take the form of one of the following phrases or of those referred to
    elsewhere in these Standing Orders:
    a) “that time for discussion on the Proposal now expire”
       i. The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the facilitator to
          immediately test for consensus on the Proposal, that is, to end any discussion
          immediately.
       ii. It should not be used in an attempt to silence dissent, and generally should only be
          used if the time allotted to debate is nearing its end.
    b) “that the Proposal be considered at a later time this day”
       i. The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the State Secretary to
          schedule time later in the day for further consideration of the Proposal at hand.
    c) “that the Proposal be considered at the next meeting”
       i. The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the State Secretary to
          include the Proposal, in its exact form, on the agenda for the next State Council
          meeting.
    d) “that the matter be considered at the next meeting”
       i. The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the State Secretary to
          schedule time on the agenda for the next State Council meeting for debate on the
          substantive matter at hand, but allows flexibility for the redrafting of any Proposals.
    e) “that the Proposal lapse”
       i. The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to defeat, rather than defer, a
          Proposal, without first testing for consensus. It should only be put if it has become
          apparent that a decision on the matter is not required.
    f) “that Proposal [number] be now considered”
       i. The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to consider a Proposal in a
          different order to that stated on the agenda.
    g) “that the Proposal be put to a vote”
       i. The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to put the Proposal at hand to a
          vote.
       ii. It should only be put for the reasons stated in the State Constitution; that is, that “if,
          after a reasonable period of time, disagreement persists and a decision cannot be
          deferred, the question will be resolved by vote.”

48.2: Except where this Constitution requires a decision to be made by consensus only, if, after a
reasonable period of time, disagreement persists and a decision should not be deferred, the question of
moving to a vote on a substantive motion will be resolved by vote. The procedural question to this effect will
be deemed to have been carried if it is supported by at least a 75 per cent majority.

```
h) “that the names and votes of State Councillors voting be recorded”
i. The effect of this procedural question being agreed is for the names of those State
Councillors voting for, against, or abstaining from the previous Proposal, to be

outcome of the Proposal in question.
iii. In the event that the list of names by vote type contradicts the total recorded in the

```
i. The effect of this procedural question being agreed is for State Council to consider a
Proposal that did not appear on the agenda.
j) “that consideration of this agenda item be extended for [number] minutes”
i. The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to extend time for discussion
beyond the time allowed for in the agenda.
k) “that the words ‘For report only’ be removed from the agenda”
i. The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to open discussion at a time
when the agenda does not allow for open discussion (see Standing Orders:
Discussion).
ii. In all but the most important of cases, State Councillors should only seek to have the
words “For report only” removed from parts of the agenda at the beginning of the
meeting.
l) “that the ruling of the facilitator be overturned”
i. The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to overturn the facilitator’s most
recent ruling on a procedural matter.
ii. It must only be raised in the most serious of cases.
m) “that the facilitator step down”
i. The effect of this procedural question being agreed is to require the facilitator to step
down, and for the State Convenor to choose another facilitator.

and, if necessary, for certain observers to be permitted to stay.
ii. This procedural question should only be raised when absolutely necessary.
```
34. Procedural questions will be minuted consistently as follows:

```
A procedural question, “that [text of question]”, was [not] agreed to.
```
35. Unlike for the recording of the outcomes of Proposals, if procedural questions are put to a vote by
    show of hands, votes, including abstentions, are not recorded in the minutes.

**Items for Discussion**

36. As far as reasonably practicable items listed for Discussion should fall into two categories:

```
a) Items listed for short discussion, which generally should be:
i. very limited in number;
ii. limited to 10 minutes duration; and
iii. either uncontroversial (e.g. a motion of thanks, which it would be inappropriate to put
through without consideration) or necessary (e.g. because the information on which a

```
```
recommendation could be based could only be available at the last minute, such as
legal advice or a cost-quote, but where the matter was otherwise uncontroversial).
b) Items listed for full discussion, which should generally:
i. be no more than 3 or 4 in number;
ii. be given a minimum of one hour each on the Agenda, or a workshop plus at least half
an hour; and
iii. as far as practicable, contain a brief summary of:
```
1. the history of the matter;
2. the contending views. (Only in unusual circumstances should a matter be listed
    for major discussion where there were no serious and contending views. As far
    as practicable, where there are contending views, any proposals which those
    holding those contending views would like to see adopted, should be circulated);
    and
3. links to relevant articles etc.
37. Proposals with budgetary implications must indicate where changes to income and/or expenditure
would need to be made in order to balance the current budget.
38. It is the particular responsibility of State Councillors representing Branches to report before the
meeting on what the issues are which are listed for major discussion, and on the outcomes of these
discussions.

**Decisions and Recommendations of Standing Committees**

39. For a Decision or Recommendation to be on notice, it must have been drawn to the attention of State
    Councillors by way of a Notice Paper that lists all of the Decisions and Recommendations made by
    the Standing Committees since the last State Council meeting 7 clear days prior to State Council.
40. Where a decision or recommendation of a Standing Committee has been omitted or abridged in part
    or whole, for reasons of confidentiality, any State Councillor may request that the full decision or
    recommendation be made available to them.

**Decisions of Standing Committees**

41. All Decisions made by Standing Committees which are “on notice” shall not unless listed be the
    subject of any consideration by State Council unless formal objection is received from either:
    a) Three members of State Council (extending beyond the membership of one Branch) given in
       writing to the State Secretary and to the Convenor of the relevant Standing Committee at least
       2 clear days prior to the meeting (e.g. Wednesday for a Saturday meeting), or
    b) Ten members of state council given in writing to the State Secretary and to the Convenor of the
       relevant Standing Committee, if present, (and in any case the facilitator of the meeting) within
       30 minutes of the commencement of the meeting;
    and stating the Decision to which objection is taken and briefly stating the grounds of objection.
42. State Councillors must not object pro forma.
43. The giving of this notice shall permit a procedural proposal to be put as follows by “That State Council
    considers proposals for the disallowance or amendment of the [identified] Decision of the [named]
    Standing Committee”.
44. After allowing not less than one speaker in favour of the procedural proposal, it shall be put to a vote,
    and if carried, the Agenda of that meeting will be altered accordingly.
45. Any Decisions of any Standing Committee which have been made but are not “on notice” must
    (unless confidential – see above) either be read out to the State Council meeting or distributed early
    in the meeting in written form. In these circumstances the procedural resolution described above may

```
```
be moved by any State Councillor during the meeting. (Note- this is a reason why as a general
proposition Standing Committee meetings should be held at least 10 days before State Council.)
```
**Recommendations of Standing Committees**

46. All the recommendations of standing committees which are on notice and which are listed “For
    Formal Approval” shall be put to State Council as a single proposal in the following form, for which
    consensus shall be tested: “That all recommendations on notice of Standing Committees not listed for
    discussion, and listed only for formal approval, be approved.” If formal objection is received from 3
    State Councillors (not all being from one Branch) in writing to the Secretary (with a copy to the
    Convenor of the relevant Standing Committee) at least 2 clear days prior to State Council, the
    relevant recommendations shall be included as normal agenda items.
47. If consensus is not reached on the proposal described above (“That all recommendations on notice of
    Standing Committees not listed for discussion, and listed only for formal approval, be approved”)
    discussion will be adjourned forthwith, after the facilitator has determined which State Councillors
    object to which recommendation(s), and the testing for consensus on the remaining
    Recommendations to which no objection is taken. It shall then be the responsibility of the State
    Secretary or Assistant State Secretary, the State Councillors and the Convenors (or if absent other
    members) of the relevant Standing Committee to discuss in respect of each objection:
    a) Whether there is an amendment which does not alter the character of the proposal but which
       can meet the objection, and that consensus be sought on that revised version of the
       recommendation; or
    b) Whether it should be referred back to the Standing Committee for further consideration;
    c) Whether the item needs to be listed for discussion, and if so at the present meeting or at a later
       meeting.
    It is the responsibility of the State Secretary or Assistant Secretary (as the case may be) to bring back
    to the meeting a procedural proposal for a course of action in respect of each Recommendation,
    consistent with the above.
48. Recommendations which do not meet the definition of on notice (7 clear days) must either be listed
    for discussion, or deferred to the next meeting.
49. Recommendations from the State Executive are to be treated in the same manner as
    recommendations from a Standing Committee. This is by way of distinction from Decisions of the
    Executive, which require ratification.

Amended State Executive 2019 - 09 - 19

1. The AGV has a commitment to openness and transparency. However, the unauthorised disclosure of
    confidential information and in camera matters may harm the AGV. There are also serious legal,
    privacy, reputational and natural justice risks in sharing such matters. To avoid doubt, this bylaw
    confers no rights on persons who are not members of the AGV.

**Confidential Information**

2. For the purpose of this bylaw, “confidential”, in relation to any information, such as a record or
    document of any kind, means that access is only available to those persons:
       (a) who, are required in the execution of their duties as an authorised office- bearer of the AGV or
          its constituent groups or as a member of any appointed or elected Committee (including of any
          body established under these rules) to have such access;
       (b) who are required in the performance of their duties as a duly appointed or authorised employee
          or agent of the AGV to have such access;
       (c) who have been authorised to have access to that information by the office-bearer or the most
          senior staff member who has the care custody or control of such information;
       (d) who have access pursuant to a decision of the State Executive or the State Council;
       (e) who are investigating a relevant matter as a member of the Misconduct or Administrative
          Review Panels, or who are required to see such information as part of an effective investigation;
          and
       (f) to whom in all the circumstances the release is harmless and reasonable.
3. Any constituent group may (subject to any contrary decision of State Council) determine that any
    information is confidential and limit access to a particular record or class of records to certain named
    persons or officers, but should do so only on reasonable grounds.
4. Until and unless a decision is otherwise made under this bylaw, the following information is confidential:

```
(a) minutes of and matters discussed in meetings held in camera;
(b) records relating to the performance, selection, appointment or termination of individual staff;
(c) records relating to litigation or potential litigation, or like dispute, where the release of such
records might prejudice the position of the Party;
(d) records relating to any commercial negotiation where the release of such records might
prejudice the position of the Party;
(e) records relating to any individual donation or like payment to the party, except as otherwise
provided for in the bylaws;
(f) any financial records of the organisation where the release of such records might prejudice the
position of the Party;
(g) any record or document provided on a bona fide confidential basis by a third party, but not
where provision was primarily made in order to render the document confidential;
```

```

```
```
(h) any document in relation to campaigning or an electoral matter whose value consists in its
contents not being widely known;
(i) any document whose release would be, in the opinion of the office-bearer or the most senior
staff member having care custody or control of that record, highly prejudicial to the Party or
unreasonably and unfairly damaging to a third party, provided that where access is denied to
any member only on this ground and no other, the member seeking access may appeal to the
next meeting of the State Executive, and shall have an opportunity to address the State
Executive, in person or in writing, as to why access should be granted, and unless the State
Executive confirms the denial, access will be granted;
(j) mediation or conciliation and any agreement entered into as a result of mediation or conciliation;
(k) complaints of bullying and harassment;
(l) complaints of sexual harassment;
(m) all aspects of a misconduct allegation, including the fact that it was made and any Notices of
Decision;
(n) proceedings before the Endorsement Review Committee;
(o) nominations for Member Recognition Awards;
(p) deliberations of the Probity Panel; and
(q) records of nominations for preselection.
```
5. Persons who receive confidential information of any kind must keep that information confidential.
6. State Council may determine that any confidential information can be made available to party members
    or publicly.
7. Where a member is authorised to release confidential information on a restricted basis, they must
    inform the people receiving the information that it should not be released more broadly without the
    express permission or instructions of State Council.
8. Breaches of confidence may be referred to the Misconduct Panel and may result in a finding of
    misconduct.

**In Camera Matters**

9. In camera sessions are closed parts of meetings. At meetings of constituent groups consisting of
    elected representatives or delegates, a meeting may decide to go in camera and only members of the
    relevant constituent group are entitled to attend, but the group may also decide to invite specified non-
    members of the relevant group to attend.
10. In camera sessions should be avoided. Meetings should only go in camera when absolutely necessary
    to maintain the confidentiality of matters discussed.
11. If a meeting goes in camera, this shall be recorded in the minutes along with:

```
(a) the general reason the meeting went in camera (identified to the level of ‘Staff Issue’, ‘Member
Dispute’, ‘Campaign Strategy’, ‘Legal Issue’, or similar); and
(b) the number of decisions made in camera.
```
12. Any decisions made in camera shall be recorded in a separate set of in camera meeting minutes with
    sufficient information and documents to ensure it is clear what has been decided.
13. In camera minutes of meetings shall not be available for viewing by anyone except the members of that
    group or of the State Executive, and such other persons the group or State Executive authorises.
14. Any State Executive decisions made in camera shall be reported to State Council for ratification in
    accordance with the Constitution. State Executive may determine that this reporting shall occur at the
    next meeting of State Council, in writing or otherwise, rather than being included in the circulated
    minutes. However, the fact that such a report shall be given shall be included in the agenda of the
    relevant State Council meeting.

    Councillors at a State Council meeting, or by such members of State Council or the Misconduct or
    Administrative Review Panels, as it determines.

1. All expenditure approvals must be allocated to an item in the current approved AGV budget.
2. Once the AGV budget is approved, any AGV members who are solely or jointly responsible for
    expenditure decisions are responsible for only approving expenditure within the approved budget,
    unless they gain approval from FAIC for a budget adjustment to accommodate the increased spend.
3. The State Director is responsible for authorising expenditure within the AGV budget, subject to the
    following conditions:
    a) The State Council has approved that a committee or working group is accountable for a specific
       budget item, in which case responsibility passes to that committee or working group.
    b) The State Director has delegated expenditure authorisation for specific budget items to AGV
       staff. In such an event, the State Director still retains accountability for the budget item against
       which the authority has been delegated.
    c) Where expenditure will result in the relevant budget item being exceeded by no more than
       $5,000, the State Director must nominate an alternate budget item or items to be reduced by
       the same value.
    d) An expenditure increase of more than $5,000 shall be referred to FAIC for consideration and if
       appropriate, funds reallocation within the approved budget.
    e) In event that the State Director takes leave, they must delegate their authorities temporarily to
       another AGV staff member/s or State Office Bearer.
    f) Delegation of authority shall be in writing and shall indicate the period for such delegation
       applies and/or when such delegation expires.
    g) In the event that State Council or State Executive has revoked a delegate's authorities and the
       State Director is on a leave of absence, authorities pass to the AGV Secretary.
    h) The AGV Secretary can temporarily assume the authorities of the State Director in the event of:
       i. The State Director is on a leave of absence and has not delegated their authorities; or
       ii. The State Director or AGV staff member to whom authority has been delegated in the
          State Director's absence, is unable to make the authorisation before the payment by the
          time it falls due.
4. In the event that a committee or working group is allocated a budget, the convener of the committee
    or working group is accountable for:
    a) Creating a detailed budget for how the funds allocated to the group or committee should be
       spent.
    b) Approving spending in accordance with that budget.
    c) Ensuring that expenditure is only made in accordance with that budget.
5. FAIC and State Executive must be notified by email or other written communication of any delegation
    of spending authority.

6. Any AGV member or Party body may put forward an expenditure or income proposal to FAIC for
    review. The proposal should include details of the expenditure (or income) including, but not limited
    to, the cost and benefits of accepting the proposal.
7. Following FAIC's review of the expenditure/income proposal, FAIC can do any of the following:

```
a) approve the proposal if the amount in question is less than $5000 and corresponding budget
offsets can be found or in line with the powers granted in the Finance, Administration and
Infrastructure Committee Bylaw.
b) recommend the proposal to State Council for approval; or
c) return the proposal to the proposer requesting further detail; or
d) choose not to recommend the proposal for approval.
```
8. State Council must approve expenditure outside the existing AGV budget that will alter the bottom
    line. By approving such proposals, State Council is acknowledging that the additional expenditure will
    result in a reduction in the surplus or increase in the deficit.

1. The Australian Greens - Victoria (AGV), as a party committed to enhancing Australia’s democratic
    process, will pursue the model of publicly funded elections at all levels of government. Publicly
    funded elections would promote more equitable access and reduce the risk of corruption associated
    with donations.
2. AGV will accept donations, including gifts-in-kind as defined by the Australian Electoral Commission,
    using transparent practices.
3. Gifts in-kind will be treated as any other donation to the AGV (for further details please see the
    Treasurer’s Handbook).
4. AGV may reject any donation or refund any donation at any time
5. AGV will ensure that where any donor’s one-off or cumulative donations to AGV totals $1,000 or
    more within a financial year their donations are subject to ethical review.
6. Any party member may request that the AGV conduct an ethical review of any donation.
7. At times AGV may also seek to finance its expenditure through loans that are not provided by
    financial institutions. These loans will be subject to ethical review where either:
    a) the value of the loan is $10,000 or more; or
    b) the loan agreement has conditions under which the loan could convert into a donation and the
       value of the loan is $1,000 or more.
8. Ethical review of donations and non-commercial loans will be undertaken by AGV State Council (or
    State Executive or State Quick Decision Making Group depending on amount and urgency) and will:
    a) seek to ensure that the values and aspirations of all donors and lenders are not inconsistent
       with those encapsulated in the goals, policies and the Charter of the Australian Greens Victoria;
    b) accept donations and loans only for supporting the aims of the Party;
    c) refuse any donation or loan if any conditions are imposed by the donor or lender;
    d) refuse any donation or loan if it gives rise to or is likely to give rise to a conflict of interest as
       defined below.
9. The person verifying that the requirements of clause 8 have been met:

```
a) will not be associated with the donor in any way as far as practicable (i.e. the verifying person
should not be a relative of the donor, co-habituating with, etc.)
b) will not be a candidates for election, nor that person's campaign manager with regard to
donations to their own or any other campaign being conducted at the same time.

```
```
c) should contact the donor to confirm that the requirements are met. Further a full audit trail of
the process should be kept (i.e. emails/correspondence confirming that the requirements have
been met).
```
10. Further, AGV will:

```
a) ensure that any donations solicited or accepted on behalf of the AGV by members or
supporters of the AGV are used for AGV endorsed activities and not for the personal use of the
member or supporter;
b) maintain transparency in donor identity by reporting within 3 months of the end of each financial
year all donors and the cumulative total of their donations to AGV over the previous financial
year where those cumulative totals amount to $1,000 or more;
c) maintaining transparency in donor identity by including in the party's Annual Returns to the
Australian Electoral Commission details of all donations which cumulatively total more than
$1,000 for the financial year”; and
d) ensure that any donations or loans received that are subsequently rejected as a result of this
bylaw are returned to the donor or lender at the earliest opportunity;
e) report all donations to local, state and federal electoral authorities as required by laws
applicable and current at the time of the donation;
f) advise potential and/or intending donors of disclosure requirements of laws referred to in 8(e)
above.
```
11. The acceptance of any donation by AGV does not imply endorsement of the activities, undertakings
    or processes of the donor.
12. It is the responsibility of the AGV State Treasurer to monitor all donations and loans received or
    offered to AGV and ensure all donations and loans which are subject to review, or may be subject to
    rejection under this bylaw are promptly referred for review.
13. To support the application of this bylaw:

```
a) donations may only be directed to the AGV state party, regional councils, branches or electoral
campaigns. Donations may be directed to campaigns for a specific election or electorate.
Donations may not be directed to individual members (including candidates and elected
representatives);
b) any donation of $1,000 or more, or any donation which there is reason to think may bring the
total donation for a particular donor to $1, 0 00 or more in a financial year, shall be referred to the
AGV State Treasurer for review prior to the donation being accepted;
c) the AGV website and other relevant documentation shall provide donors with information on
statutory disclosure requirements and the disclosure principles embodied in this by-law;
d) an official AGV receipt will be issued and the name and address of the donor recorded for all
donations unless the donor requests the donation be anonymous. Any donation of $50 or more
must have an official AGV receipt issued and the name and address of the donor recorded.
Anonymous donations of $50 or more cannot be accepted. This is to facilitate monitoring
cumulative individual donations against the $1,000 disclosure limit;
e) Where the donor of a donation in excess of $50 cannot be identified within 3 months of the
donation, the money will be moved to a trust account where it may be held for a period of up to
6 months to facilitate a further attempt to identify the donor. If after this time the donor cannot
be identified the money will be forwarded on to a charity of FAIC’s choice. These transactions
may be authorised by the Senior Most Staff member or their delegate;
f) any donations accepted on behalf of the AGV shall be deposited into an AGV bank account or
petty cash fund within 7 days;
g) all donations received by branches, regional councils or election campaign committees shall be
reported to the AGV Finance Officer quarterly. This report shall include an itemized list of
donations including the name and address of each non-anonymous donor.

**Definitions**

**Donations:**

(from [http://www.aec.gov.au](http://www.aec.gov.au) “Funding and Disclosure Handbook for Donors and Third Parties”)

```
A disposition of property or provision of a service for which no payment, or an inadequate
payment, is received. The term includes cash and non-cash (gift-in-kind) transactions, but
does not include commercial transactions or volunteer labour.
```
(NB. This is a summary and the full AEC definition should be consulted.)

**Conflict of Interest:**

AGV adopts the OECD definition of conflict of interest which is:

A ‘conflict of interest’ involves a conflict between the public duty and the private interests of a public official,
in which the public official has private interests which could improperly influence the performance of their
official duties and responsibilities.

Public duty. It is the duty of members of The Greens to uphold the Greens Charter and promote our
policies. It is the public duty of elected representatives and other officials of The Greens to represent their
constituents impartially and act without undue influence in the community interest.

Private interests. Candidates, elected representatives and other officials of The Greens are the
beneficiaries of political donations directly or to the Party and hence have a private interest in those
donations. They could be, or could be reasonably perceived to be, influenced by donations (and a desire to
maintain them) in the conduct of their public duties. In general larger donations have a greater potential to
give rise to the perception of a conflict of interest.

Conflict. Conflict arises where decisions are actually, potentially or perceived to be made against the public
interest and/or duty as a result of private interests. In addition a conflict of interest exists if the donor is
likely to receive a material benefit from a reasonably foreseeable decision that could be made by the Party
or an elected Green, unless such benefit is likely to occur as a result of the donor being a member of such
a broad class of beneficiary that their individual benefit is not readily identifiable or known or distinguishable
from other members of that class.

A conflict of interest also still exists where a donation is received from a third party or associated entity
related to the individual or entity where the conflict of interest originates.

Approved State Council 2009 - 06 - 21

Amended State Council 2019 - 02 - 23
```
1. All Greens public office-holders* have a responsibility under the constitution and this bylaw to report
    regularly to relevant party bodies* and to the Greens membership generally and within their own
    constituencies. Office bearers also have a responsibility to provide reports and information to elected
    public officeholders.
2. Reporting regularly is an important means by which public office-holders remain accountable to the
    party.
3. It is expected that all public office-holders of the party will attend State Conference whenever
    possible, and provide a verbal report, which will be listed for discussion.
4. At each regular meeting of State Council, a verbal report from the federal parliamentarians
    representatives, the state parliamentarians representatives and the local government representatives
    will be listed for discussion. Where no representatives are in attendance, a written report must be
    submitted.
5. Party members should not assume that, acting as individuals, they have any special or privileged
    access or rights in relation to elected representatives as compared to constituents generally.
    Similarly, elected representatives, while they have special expertise and knowledge, have no more
    right than other members to direct the work of Party bodies.

**Reporting and Liaison Requirements**

6. The reporting arrangements need not be mechanical or prescriptive, but must ensure that:

```
a) in the case of public office-holders, the relevant bodies are provided with a verbal report
(default) or written report (if attendance is not possible), which should aim to cover:
i. main activities undertaken;
ii. key decisions made as a public office-holder;
iii. major issues which are pending;
iv. the planned approach to these issues; and
v. issues in which they are involved where their position is likely to involve considerable
public controversy or are likely to be controversial within the Party. In these
circumstances, wherever possible, a report should be provided in sufficient time to
allow relevant party bodies* to consider the issue when that consideration will still be
relevant;
b) in the case of office-bearers of relevant regions or branches, relevant public office-holders are
advised of the views of relevant party bodies, about matters within the current work or priorities
of the public office-holders, faithfully and in good time, particularly where issues have become
or are likely to become controversial within the Party.

**Definitions**

Election Period: Defined as the period from when nominations for any election are opened until
the election occurs.

Probity Check: A probity check investigates the background of an individual to determine their
suitability to be a candidate.

Decision-making period: The period when the Probity Panel considers and comes to a decision about a
nominee being the time commencing when all probity-related nomination
documentation has been sent to the Probity Panel, and concluding when a
probity decision has been reported to the Returning Officer.

**Probity Panel**

1. There shall be established a Probity Panel whose duty it is to carry out all probity checks on all
    nominees for external positions.
2. The purpose of the Probity Panel is to judge the suitability of members who nominate to stand as
    candidates in external elections. In so doing, it is not the task of the Probity Panel to make conclusive
    findings of fact in relation to any matter adverse to a nominee, nor is this necessary for the Probity
    Panel to reject a nomination.
3. Noting that the AGV Constitution states [at 8.1] that

```
“All AGV Members are entitled to the following benefits: ... (f) To be eligible to seek nomination
for public office as a candidate for the Greens (NC 9.8), subject to clause 56.13”,

```
probity should only be rejected where there are compelling and serious reasons why, in the interests
of the AGV, the member should be deemed not suitable to stand as a candidate.
```
4. The paramount duty of the Probity Panel is to make decisions in the best interests of the AGV. The
    Probity Panel will, in this regard, consider the values, policy positions and political imperatives of the

    a call for expressions of interest via the appropriate internal Party communication methods, as per
    Schedule 1.

    body (where a preselection panel has been appointed) will have the right to inspect the record of any
    individual where they are considering a matter related to and relevant to that member.

declaration that no matters relevant to a police report have substantially changed since that
report was prepared; and
e) any other document or form requested by the Probity Panel or a Probity sub-panel.
provided that a nominee who has been approved by a Probity Panel within the previous 3 months
may provide the statutory declaration described in clause 2 5 (b) above in substitution for the
documents required in this clause and a check with the most senior staff member and Victorian
Campaign Committee or electorate and regional campaign committee Convenor confirms this is
confirmed.

```
bearers, party officials and other members as considered necessary.
```
29. The nominee shall provide:

```
a) All names that they have used or previously been known by,
b) All pseudonyms that they use or have previously used,
c) Access to all Probity sub-panel members of all social media and online engagement accounts
currently in use by the nominee or which were in use within the previous five (5) years. This
access shall be maintained for the duration of the decision-making period. This access may
include, for example, allowing Probity sub-panel members to ‘friend’ them on Facebook,
ensuring Probity sub-panel members can ‘follow’ all of the nominee’s Twitter accounts and
ensuring any other action is taken which provides the Probity sub-panel members such access.
```
30. The Probity Panel may contact any person while conducting a probity check without reference to the
    nominee.
31. Confidentiality will be maintained as follows:

```
a) Any person contacted by the Probity Panel will be advised of the confidential nature of the
process in that they should not disclose that the person has nominated, nor should they
disclose the questions asked by or their response made to the Probity Panel to any other
person.
b) All responses received by the Probity Panel shall be kept confidential to the Probity Panel and
shall only be disclosed as a non-identifying summary should clause 41 be enacted.
```
32. The Probity Panel shall make a finding for each nomination received by the end of the decision-
    making period that the nomination be:
    a) approved, or
    b) approved subject to certain conditions outlined by the Probity Panel, or
    c) approved noting risk/communication matters if preselected, or
    d) rejected.
    A sub-panel may only make this finding by consensus. Should consensus not be achieved the
    nomination will be considered by the full Probity Panel, at which a majority will be required to make
    the finding.
    Subject to 34, 39 and 40 below, the decision-making period must be no later than fourteen (14) days
    (or 48 hours in the case of a snap election) after the close of nominations.
    In the case of a nominee being approved with conditions, the office bearers of the relevant Campaign
    Committee will be provided with a summary of conditions by the probity panel and will be tasked with
    tracking compliance of conditions. Any breaches of conditions must then be referred to the
    Endorsement Review Committee.
33. The Probity Panel shall have the authority to:

```
a) request further statutory declarations from any nominee should the panel judge that more
information be required to make an assessment on any nomination.
b) interview any nominee should the panel judge that more information be required to make an
assessment on any nomination.
In these circumstances, the decision-making period may be extended to allow reasonable time for the
nominee to comply.
```
34. If the nomination is approved subject to certain conditions or rejected, the decision shall be
    considered to be an interim decision until the process at 39 – 40 is complete, whereby a final decision
    will be made.
35. The Probity Panel members considering a nomination shall reject any nomination where:

```
a) the sub-panel judges that the candidacy of the nominee concerned would be inappropriate,
```

Probity By-law - Version 20 19 - 09 - 19 Page **88** of **106**

```
Please consider the environment before you print this document. Choose eco-friendly paper stock. Reduce paper usage by sharing with someone
```
```
b) the sub-panel judges that the candidacy of the nominee would be detrimental to the Australian
Greens Victoria on grounds relating to past conduct, character or reputation,
c) the candidate has not given an undertaking to support stated party policy, subject to clause
51.2 of the constitution, or in lieu of that undertaking, has not provided pre-selectors with an
explanation as to which policies the candidate does not support.
```
36. The Probity Panel shall have the authority to reject any nomination on the grounds that the nominee:

```
a) refuses to co-operate with the probity panel
b) fails to comply with any conditions outlined in the relevant Code of Conduct forms
c) fails to comply with any conditions outlined in the Confidentiality Agreement
d) fails to comply with any condition imposed upon the nominee in relation to their nomination (as
per 35 (b) above)
e) holds a public position in opposition to Party policy, and the probity sub-panel deems the matter
to be so serious as to damage the party’s electoral opportunities.
Prima facie a serious falsehood or apparent serious concealment of facts or issues in probity forms is
grounds for a nomination to be rejected.
```
37. Where the Probity Panel rejects a nomination, the nominee may not nominate for any other position
    at the same election.
38. When an interim decision is made to either approve a nomination subject to certain conditions or
    reject a nomination, the following will occur:
    a) The Probity sub-panel will prepare a document setting out the reasons for the decision.
    b) The nominee will be provided with the reasons for decision and shall have 48 hours to provide a
       response to the Probity sub-panel.
    c) The reasons for the decision may include a summary of feedback received, without breaching
       the confidentiality requirements at clause 32.
    d) The Probity sub-panel will consider any response from the nominee in making a final decision.
    e) A final decision will be made within 48 hours of receipt of any response from the nominee. If
       the nominee fails to provide a response, the original decision will stand.
    In these circumstances, the decision-making period may be extended to allow for these processes to
    occur.
39. Clause 39 above shall not apply in the circumstances of a snap-election.
40. When a decision is approved noting that risk and/or communications matters require attention, the
    Returning Officer will notify the Probity Panel of the nominee’s preselection. Then Probity Panel will
    then inform the Convenor of the relevant Campaign Committee in writing of the risk and
    communications issues which require a plan.
41. Decisions of the Probity Panel:

```
a) will be reported to the relevant Returning Officer and the nominee within 24 hours of the
decision
b) may be appealed to the State Executive.
```
**Rights of Nominees**

42. A nominee will be informed of who is on the Probity Panel and which members will be reviewing their
    nomination.
43. A nominee will be informed as soon as practical of any decision by the Probity Panel in relation to
    their nomination, in accordance with clauses 33 and 39 above.
44. A nominee may provide a written response to any decision to approve their nomination subject to
    conditions, or to reject their nomination, in accordance with clause 39 above.

45. A nominee may appeal a decision of the Probity Panel to the State Executive in accordance with

    conditions, or to reject their nomination. A decision will be made by State Executive within 24 hours of
    the appeal.
46. A nomination for any position is considered confidential until the nominations close and the Probity
    Panel has completed its work. Until that time nominations may be withdrawn without prejudice. After
    that time an announcement of the nominations will be made on the internal AGV website.

**Confidentiality of Records**

47. All records in relation to the making of a decision in respect of a probity decision shall be kept
    securely and separately for a period of 5 years, provided that any authorisation to obtain a police
    report and accompanying appropriately certified copies of identification will be securely destroyed as
    soon as they are no longer needed. The State Secretary will have the responsibility of safe custody.
48. All members of the Probity Panel will be responsible for permanently deleting any electronic copies
    they hold of documents related to Probity Panel decisions (other than Panel minutes) within one

**Schedule 2 - Probity Form**

**Statement by AGV**

The Australian Greens Victoria has rigorous probity and pre-selection procedures for candidates, in which
they are required to answer detailed questions about their prior conduct, statements and associations. This
requires the completion of a detailed Statutory Declaration. However, potential candidates should not be
discouraged if there is something “adverse” about which they are required to provide information. The AGV
is not looking for perfect “plastic” candidates, and there will be few people who will not have some difficult
or even embarrassing matters in their past. Therefore, you should not be too concerned if you need to
disclose such matters on the form. Refusal of probity is rare.

**Acknowledgement by Candidate**

I acknowledge that I am required to read carefully and answer truthfully and completely each of the
questions set out in the Statutory Declaration. I also acknowledge that failure to disclose in my Declaration
any matter within my knowledge (whether I consider it to be important on not) is not only perjury, but would
mean that I would need to show cause to the Probity Panel why I should not have Probity approval refused,
as it would tend to show a serious lack of competence or integrity. I further acknowledge that should I gain
pre-selection, non-disclosure now would be grounds for subsequent dis-endorsement.

**Definitions**

Ballot: A ballot may be either postal, attendance or electronic or combination of any of those
options.

Snap Election: Any election for which the period from the announcement to the date of the election is
less than 8 calendar weeks. The minimum federal election campaign period is 33 days.

**Scope**

1. Notwithstanding any resolution of State Council which places any condition on any preselection, this
    bylaw determines the method of preselecting candidates, under clause 56.1 of the Constitution, for all
    electorates for the next Federal, State and Local elections.
2. The purpose of preselection is to judge the desirability of a member as a candidate to represent the
    Party in an external election.
3. When voting members should take into account the ability of the candidate:

```
a) to work with a campaign team to achieve local and state goals and targets;
b) to clearly articulate Greens’ value, policies and key campaign messages;
c) to effectively represent Greens values and implement Greens policies when holding public
office.
```
**Returning Officer**

4. The body conducting the preselection must appoint a Returning Officer, a position which may be
    shared by up to 2 people. Once appointed, the Returning Officer shall be responsible for conducting,
    and ensuring the proper conduct in accordance with the rules of, the preselection in question.
5. The Returning Officer shall not be eligible to be a nominee for the preselection in question, or
    nominate any person for the preselection in question, or sit on the probity panel associated with the
    preselection in question.

```

```
6. The Returning Officer will be the primary contact between nominees, candidates, any probity panel
    established and other Greens members making enquiries, for any election they are required to
    conduct.
7. The Returning Officer may appoint up to 2 people to act as deputy returning officers to assist in the
    duties of the Returning Officer. Final authority and responsibility remains with the Returning Officer.
8. The Returning Officer will ensure that where the implementation of any election requires the use of
    AGV office resources, measures are taken to ensure that the most senior member of AGV staff is
    consulted, and that preselection materials (such as reply paid envelopes) are distinguished from
    those of any other election that may be occurring at the same time.
9. The Returning Officer will be the final authority on the interpretation of the preselection rules.
10. The Victorian Campaigning Committee Convenor and the preselection body Convenor shall be
    available should the Returning Officer require guidance when interpreting any rule or when the rules
    do not provide sufficient information. These Convenors may agree to allow the Returning Officer to
    alter a rule should the Returning Officer strongly advise that unusual and compelling circumstances
    necessitate an alteration.

**Nomination**

11. The Returning Officer will ensure the publication, to all eligible voters and linked to from the AGV e-
    bulletin, of the relevant dates and deadlines associated with the preselection (which shall include as a
    minimum the times of opening and closing of nominations and the deadline by which votes must be
    returned), and information for prospective candidates, which will be compliant with the Constitution.
12. There will be at least 2 weeks between the opening and closing of nominations, and at least 2 weeks
    between the opening and closing of voting unless a Snap Election has been called (see below).
13. For a nomination to be valid, nominees must be members of the AGV at the time of nomination, at the
    time of the vote count and during the entire relevant election period.
14. To nominate for election, eligible members shall provide the Returning Officer with:

```
a) Their nomination in a form prescribed by the Returning Officer;
b) A statement for eligible voters, of no more than 800 words, which shall include how long the
member has been a member, the name of the Branch to which the member is registered, a
brief list of positions held by the member within the party and previous candidacies for public
office, and any other information the member sees fit to include, which should generally include
the member’s political and philosophical positions on key issues facing the party and the
position being elected;
c) Statements of support of up to 200 words from four other members for the purposes of
preselections for lead upper house Federal or State electorates, or from two other members for
the purposes of all other preselections. Statements of support must not be provided by current
AGV staff, State Office Bearers, campaign committee office bearers, candidates for public
office, or elected representatives. Statements of support may include how long the supporting
member has been a member, the name of the Branch to which the supporting member is
registered, and any other information the supporting member may wish to include. The
statement may be augmented by up to 75 words in order to include a brief list of positions held
by the supporting member within the party, including previous candidacies for public office;
d) A clear photo of themselves (optional);
e) A signed and completed Probity documents;
f) A Statutory Declaration attesting to the correctness of the Probity Form;
g) A signed copy of the relevant Code of Conduct form; and
h) A signed Tithing Pledge;

```
```
i) Nominees for federal elections only: A truthfully completed copy of the Australian Electoral
Commission document regarding section 44 of the Commonwealth Constitution called the
‘Qualification Checklist: Relating to Section 44 of the Constitution.’
```
15. The Returning Officer must immediately submit any document received under clause 14(i) to the
    Victorian Campaign Committee (‘VCC’) which must decide (as quickly as reasonably possible)
    whether further enquiry is needed to determine whether a nominee is presently eligible to be
    nominated for election or is reasonably likely to be able to become eligible in the time before
    nominations are required. The VCC may seek the assistance of appropriately qualified members in
    making this decision. If the VCC decides that further enquiry is needed, the Returning Officer, after
    having consulted with the VCC as to how long these enquiries are likely to take, may refuse the
    nomination or delay the preselection to allow such enquiries to be made The Returning Officer may,
    at any time, revisit a decision to delay the preselection.
16. A nomination will normally be refused by the Returning Officer if the member has not provided the
    information in the previous clause by the published deadline. Otherwise, the Returning Officer will
    confirm with all prospective nominees the list of approved nominees. To avoid doubt the Returning
    Officer’s decision will be final.

**Conduct of Preselection**

17. Nominees may not discuss their nomination or the election in question with any journalist, other than
    to confirm their candidacy.
18. Nominees may not expend funds for the purposes of communicating with eligible voters in relation to
    the election in question.
19. Nominees shall receive from the Returning Officer a list of eligible members’ names, phone numbers
    and email addresses, and may instigate contact with each eligible voter for the purposes of
    discussing or promoting their nomination. The nominee must not show or distribute the list to any
    other person, and must destroy the list within one week of the declaration of the result of the election
    in question, or when the State Returning Officer has revoked nomination, whichever occurs first.
20. Until the declaration of the result, nominees may not attend Branch meetings other than those of the
    Branch to which they are registered, except to carry out a specific duty, in which case they must
    nevertheless not discuss their nomination for the election in question at that Branch meeting.
21. Subject to the following, members are entitled to express their opinions on any nominees. However.
    any statements made in relation to nominees or candidates must not be misleading or deceptive and,
    unless in private communication, must be provided to the Returning Officer prior to the statement
    being made.
22. Party bodies, State Office Bearers, persons employed by the AGV, and elected representatives must
    not:
    a) by any means, directly or indirectly, make a statement canvassing for or against votes for any
       nominee; or
    b) provide any resources to aid any nominee.
23. Notwithstanding Clause 22, any member is entitled to act under clause 26 at Meet the Candidates
    Events as long as they speak as an individual and not on behalf of their position or the body they
    represent.
24. The Returning Officer may revoke a nominee’s nomination if they are in breach of any of rules of the
    party in relation to the election in question.

**Meet the Candidates Event**

25. The body conducting the preselection, in consultation with the Returning Officer (or their deputies),
    will be responsible for organising any “Meet the Candidates” events. In doing so it should generally:
    a) for senate elections hold at least 1 event per state legislative council region

```
b) for federal divisions hold at least 1 event per division
c) for state legislative council regions hold at least 2 events per region
d) for state legislative assembly districts hold at least 1 event per district
e) for local government elections hold at least 1 event per local government municipality
f) for by-elections hold at least 1 event for that by-election.

26. Any meet the candidates event should enable all members in attendance to, subject to the facilitator’s
    and Returning Officer’s discretion:
    a) ask questions of any nominees;
    b) make statements about who eligible voters should vote for or against; and
    c) make statements about the issues facing the party and the position being elected that they
       believe should be taken into account by eligible voters.
27. Any meet the candidates event should enable all nominees in attendance to, subject to the
    facilitator’s and Returning Officer’s discretion, respond to any questions raised or statements made by
    members.

**Probity**

28. A probity check shall be conducted on all nominees in accordance with the Probity bylaw.

29. The body conducting the preselection may choose to conduct that preselection in accordance with
    one or combination of the below methods:
    a) Postal ballot;
    b) Electronic ballot;
    c) Attendance ballot;
    d) Selection panel, but only if State Council or the Victorian Campaign Committee has agreed and
       either:
          i. the Greens primary vote in the previous election for the electorate concerned was less
             than 8 per cent; or
ii. the position being preselected is a non-lead candidate for any Federal or State upper
house electorate; or
       iii. less than 16 weeks remain until the election date, for Federal, State and Local elections;
    e) Any other method, but only if proposed rules for that method are approved by the Victorian

```
a) all nominees who have successfully passed probity will be interviewed by the panel;
b) a “Meet the Candidates” event need not be held;

election as an endorsed Greens candidate;
d) where possible, the membership of the Selection Panel shall include at least one person from
each branch within the electorate;

```
f) all candidates shall be allotted the same amount of time by the selection panel, although any
interview may be extended at the discretion of the Selection Panel as required;
g) the Selection Panel shall meet prior to the interviews and decide on a pre-prepared list of
questions prior to conducting interviews with nominees. Nominees shall not be advised of
these questions prior to the interview. Each nominee shall be given the opportunity to answer
each pre- prepared question within the allotted interview time;
h) the Selection Panel shall allow each nominee an opportunity to introduce themselves and
explain why they would be an appropriate candidate for the electorate. The Selection Panel
may ask supplementary questions which arise during the course of the interview;
i) each nominee shall be interviewed separately and privately, with only members of the Selection
Panel, the Returning Officer and the nominee in attendance;

k) the panel will notify the Returning Officer of their decision as soon as is practicable. The
Returning Officer will notify the Victorian Campaign Committee immediately following receiving
notification.
```
**Ballots**

31. For preselections involving a ballot, a roll of eligible voters shall be kept by the Returning Officer, with
    the names checked at the distribution of ballots and, for postal elections, also at the return of ballots.
32. Ballots shall be by Optional Preferential Voting, except where there are two or more positions to be
    filled by the one ballot, in which case a Single Transferrable Vote method shall be used.
33. All ballots must include as an option, alongside nominees, the seeking of further candidates.
34. Except if the preselection method is by attendance ballot, ballot packs shall be created for eligible
    voters, which shall include:
    a) The ballot (if it is a paper ballot it must be signed by the Returning Officer at the point of issue);
    b) Return-addressed reply-paid or stamped envelopes, and secret envelopes, if the ballot is
       conducted by post;
    c) A document, or a link to a document, containing each candidate’s statement, photo (if provided)
       and the statements of their nominators, as well as voting instructions; and
    d) a reminder of the need for diversity.
35. Voting options on ballots must be arranged by Robson Rotation.
36. If the method of preselection is by attendance ballot or by electronic ballot, the Returning Officer must
    so far as practicable provide any eligible voter who requests the option to cast a postal ballot.
37. The counting of ballots after the deadline for return of ballots will be at a time for which notice has
    been given to all nominees by the Returning Officer. Nominees may choose to appoint one member
    to observe the vote count.

**Costs**

38. All financial costs associated with preselection, including room hire, printing and postage of ballot
    packs, shall be met by the body conducting the preselection.

```

```
**Disputes**

39. Should any member believe that there has been a material breach of this by-law or the rules of any
    preselection, they matter may be first raised with the Returning Officer, and, if necessary thereafter,
    raised with the Administrative Review Panel.

**Results**

40. Until such time as any preselection result is announced by the Returning Officer, nominees may not
    comment on the result publicly, nor may any other member of the Party.
41. The declaration of any result of any election conducted by the State Returning Officer shall be final.
    Whilst in some circumstances the governing body may seek to declare a position vacant in order to
    conduct a new election, it is not able to deem the State Returning Officer’s declared result to be
    incorrect.
42. All election documentation, including ballot papers and results, shall be kept by the Returning Officer
    for 60 days after the event. Results shall be made available to any candidate or elector on request.

**Snap Elections**

43. In the event of a snap election:

```
a) all affected electorates are considered open for nominations where a candidate has not already
been preselected for a future election, except where the Victorian Campaign Committee
determines otherwise (for example if a particular preselection is about to be concluded
anyway);
b) the Victorian Campaign Committee:
i. may exercise all the powers of State Council in relation to Chapter 5 of the Constitution;
ii. will issue a call for nominations for all affected electorates for which a candidate has not
already been preselected for a future election;
iii. will assist branches and other campaigning bodies with conducting preselections in the
most timely manner possible but will in any regards have the ability to appoint by selection
panel a candidate to represent the AGV to any electorate which remains unfilled 4 days
before the deadline for submitting candidate names to the relevant Electoral Commission.
c) the State Returning Officer becomes the Returning Officer for any electorate for which a
Returning Officer has not been appointed. They may, at their discretion, appoint Deputy
Returning Officers to aid them in their duties. The requirements that Returning Officers, deputy
or otherwise, remain uninvolved in other preselection matters must be observed.
d) the Probity Panel will have until 48 hours after the close of nominations for preselection to
conclude its duties.
e) the default method of preselection will be assumed to be either electronic ballot or preselection
panel. Other methods may be approved by the VCC on a case by case basis.
f) a decision to appoint a candidate by preselection panel still requires concurrent decisions of the
preselecting body and the VCC, or the VCC and the State Executive.
```
**Eligibility**

44. The AGV will not allow a candidate’s name to be submitted for nomination to the AEC for a federal
    election for any House of Representatives or Senate seat where the person has not demonstrated
    their eligibility to sit in the federal parliament according to section 44 of the Australian Constitution.
45. In circumstances where a candidate may be under acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or
    adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights and privileges of a


Preselection By-law - Version 20 19 - 09 - 19 Page **103** of **106**

```
```
subject or a citizen of a foreign power, the candidate must provide written confirmation of renunciation
of any rights of citizenship. In cases where renunciation is not possible or practicable, comprehensive
evidence of an attempt to renounce is required. The VCC will assess whether any evidence
submitted is sufficient.
```
46. At any time, the Victorian Campaign Committee may direct a preselected candidate for a federal
    election to answer questions in writing regarding their eligibility to be nominated for election. A refusal
    to comply with such a direction is sufficient grounds for disendorsement.
47. A preselected candidate for a federal election must complete and submit the Australian Electoral
    Commission document regarding section 44 of the _Commonwealth Constitution_ called the
    ‘Qualification Checklist: Relating to Section 44 of the Constitution’, should that form have changed in
    any way since the candidate completed it at the time of nominating for preselection.

## 30 Procedures for Urgent Withdrawal of Party Endorsement of a Candidate for Public Office

**Modification History**

```
Action Body Date
```
```
Approved State Executive 2010 - 03 - 11
```
```
Updated State Council 2010 - 04 - 17
```
1. Any endorsed candidate for public office may be removed as a candidate under these procedures. In
    this bylaw, the “ERC” shall mean the Endorsement Review Committee constituted under this bylaw.
2. These procedures cease at any stage should the relevant candidate withdraw as a candidate.
3. These procedures must be initiated by a notice, which may be in writing or by telephone, from a
    public office-holder (including the Parliamentary Leader of the Australian Greens), or a member of
    State Council, to the State Convenor or Secretary or the convenor of the State-wide campaign
    committee, which notice need only state the name of the candidate proposed for de-selection, but
    may include any other relevant matter.
4. If possible, the State Convenor, the Secretary and the convenor of the State-wide campaign
    committee shall confer. If any of them thinks the matter should proceed, they shall forthwith:
    a) advise the candidate;
    b) convene the ERC; and
    c) advise any relevant Regional Convenor.
5. The ERC shall be convened at a time having regard to the desirability of allowing sufficient time for
    the candidate to respond, but also to any urgency having regard to the political circumstances, but in
    any case shall not be convened until at least 8 hours (excluding midnight to 6am) after a written
    notice has been sent to the candidate setting out the reasons why it is considered necessary that he
    or she might need to be disendorsed, advising the time and place of the ERC meeting (and any
    phone number by which its meeting may be attended). The candidate should have the opportunity to
    address the ERC, and every attempt shall be made to contact the candidate to ensure that the notice
    has been received. Copies of the notice shall be sent to the relevant Regional Convenor and, in the
    case of a Federal candidate, to the Parliamentary Leader of the Australian Greens. The ERC shall
    consist of:
    a) the Convenor or nominee, or where the Convenor is absent or fails to nominate, the Secretary
       or nominee;
    b) the convenor of the State-wide campaign committee or nominee, or where the convenor of the
       State-wide campaign committee is absent or fails to nominate, the secretary of the State-wide
       campaign committee;
    c) a person elected (or agreed by consensus) by and from those members of State Council
       present at a meeting of State Council who are or have been a candidate for public office during
       the previous 5 years. However, the person elected shall not at the time of the ERC meeting be
       a current candidate or public office-holder. (An election for this position shall be held in every
       second year or whenever necessary. However, the person elected shall in any case hold office
       until replaced.) If that person is unwilling, absent or disqualified, he or she shall be replaced on
       the ERC by a person of at least 10 years membership who has been more than once a
       candidate for public office, nominated by the Convenor or Secretary.
6. The ERC shall determine its own procedures having regard to the circumstances and urgency of the
    matter. All proceedings before the ERC are confidential. The ERC shall have access to all relevant
    probity documents and candidate agreements, and may interview any person involved in any probity

```
check. In the case of a Federal candidate, the Parliamentary Leader of the Australian Greens shall
have the right to confer with the ERC, and in any case, the ERC shall have regard to her or his
advice, which may be given in confidence.
```
7. The terms of reference of the ERC shall be to determine whether, in all the circumstances there are
    clear and compelling reasons why it is in the interests of the Party to cancel a candidate’s
    endorsement, and if the ERC so determines, it shall cancel the candidate’s endorsement.
8. Proceedings before the ERC are not disciplinary or penalty proceedings. Therefore,

```
a) it is not necessary that any allegation or suggestion in relation to any conduct by the candidate
be proven for the ERC to make any decision;
b) where an issue involves an allegation or suggestion related to any past or present conduct by
the candidate, the ERC has no brief to make any adverse determinative findings of fact against
the candidate in respect of that alleged or suggested conduct. (This does not prevent any
subsequent disciplinary proceedings against a candidate or former candidate in accordance
with other relevant party procedures.);
c) where a decision to cancel the candidate’s endorsement occurs in circumstance where the
candidate denies any allegation or suggestions in relation to his or her conduct, any public
statement by the Party shall acknowledge this denial.

9. The ERC may authorise the making of a statement on behalf of the AGV following its decision.
    Where appropriate, an attempt shall be made to reach agreement with the candidate or former
    candidate about the terms of that statement.
10. A decision of the ERC to cancel a candidate’s pre-selection must be by consensus, but is final,
    provided that the ERC may refer the matter to the State Executive for a final decision if it is not
    certain, and shall do so if it cannot reach consensus. In this case, an Executive meeting shall be
    called forthwith to determine the matter. The members of the ERC and the Parliamentary Leader of
    the Australian Greens shall as far as practicable, be in attendance, but otherwise the meeting shall be
    closed, unless the Executive decides that others may attend.
